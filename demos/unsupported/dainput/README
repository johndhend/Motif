DAINPUT
-------

This demo shows how get internationalized text input in a 
drawingarea widget. It has the necessary calls to set up and 
handle the connection with the input method: XmImRegister, 
XmImSetValues, XmImSetFocusValues and XmImUnsetFocus.

This demo only does text input. It does not try to be a text editor,
so there is no way to delete text, select text etc. The intention
is to show the use of the XmIm API.

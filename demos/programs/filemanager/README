			  Filemanager
                          -----------

Filemanager is a demonstration of the XmContainer widget, the
XmIconGadget, the Motif pixmap reader (which now can read XPM
files) and also serves to show the usage of the X resource mechanism.

It does allow for some configuration of actions and icons.

To use the demo,  simply run it from the directory of interest.
Navigation is obtained by activating (double clicking) the folder
icons (.., or a subdir),  by selecting a parent directory from the
option menu,  or by using the "Open..." menu item to enter a
pathname.

Read the man page for details on setting resources to customize
the application.

The xpm files supplied can be installed in your normal bitmap/pixmap
repository and note that you can customize this for Motif by using
the XBMLANGPATH environment variable.

The help file can be installed in a place where it will be found
via XFILESEARCHPATH,  where the type replacement (%T) will have
the value of "help."  For example, /usr/lib/X11/help/filemanager.help.

Douglas Rand

*  This application may have a memory leak, or other bugs, do not use
   when logged in as a root user.

*  This demo is known for crashing without message after make + install
   because it can't find it's runtime resources.  Compile it here int the
   demo directory after make insall, and works it fine.  It has a few
   useful features not show in menu:  launch program, edit in vi, drop
   name of selected file to X's clipboard (ie, paste in xterm).

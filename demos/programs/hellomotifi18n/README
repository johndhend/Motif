! HISTORY
This directory contains an internationalized version of the sample 
UIL/Xm program hellomotif, a simple program with a label and a push button.

This version has been localized to the following languages:
	english
	french
	hebrew
	japanese (EUC encoding)
	swedish

The localization is accomplished by having different UIL files for the 
different languages, also called locales. 

There is also a UIL file for the default locale, C. This file is equivalent 
to the english UIL file.

To locate the UID files, the demo is using the $UIDPATH environment
variable, which requires you to set $XAPPLRESDIR to ".", and the $LANG
or the xnlLanguage resource to one of languages mentioned above.
(use *xnlLanguage: $LANG in your .Xdefaults or on the command line if 
 your system doesn't let you set $LANG to anything except C).


The fonts needed for the demos are:

    french, swedish: *-helvetica-medium-r-normal--14-*-iso8859-1
    english: *-times-medium-r-normal--14-*-iso8859-1
    hebrew: *-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-iso8859-8
    japanese (fontset): *medium-r*--14* 

If you don't have those fonts installed on your system, you can
change the uil files to reference other fonts. The bdf directory
contains a hebrew font (heb8x13.bdf), and two japanese fonts, both of 
which are needed for japanese (7x14rk.bdf is for english characters
and k14-1.bdf is for kanji). If you want to use these, you will need to
compile and install them first.


If your operating system/X implementation uses other names to indicate
the locale than the ones mentioned above, you may need change the names 
of the appropriate subdirectories.

To find out the locale names on your system, refer to the setlocale man page
(you may need to look at the man pages this refers to instead). Two common 
locations for system locale files are /usr/lib/locale and /usr/lib/nls.

To find out what locales are supported by your X implementation, you 
would normally look in /usr/lib/X11/nls. If X is installed somewhere else, 
there should be a directory named "nls" one or more levels under the 
"lib" directory.

NOTE: You may need to set the environment variable XNLSPATH. If this demo
crashes on startup, set XNLSPATH to the path of the X nls directory (see
previous paragraph). See the X library documentation for more information.

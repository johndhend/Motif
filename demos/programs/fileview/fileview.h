/*
 * The "more" program Motif-ied
 * 
 *	Allow a user to view files in separate windows.
 * 	There is one top level shell created per file opened.
 * 	Each top level shell is parent of a Main Window, the work area
 * 	of which is a PanedWindow.
 * 
 *
 * The File menu contains commands Open, and Exit or Close
 * In the primary top level shell, Exit exits the client
 *  In the secondaries, Close closes the shell
 *
 *  Open
 * 	On selecting Open/File in the menu bar, a file selection box
 *	is mapped to choose the file.
 *
 *	If OpenFile is successful, close first the current file opened, 
 *      destroy all existing panes, and display the new file.
 *
 * 	Close: this entry only exists on the secondary windows.
 *	It destroys the top level shell and closes the file.
 *	
 *	Exit: this entry only exists on the primary window
 *	 closes the file and exits.
 *
 * The View menu:
 *  	
 *	New Pane: Creates a new pane in the paned window
 *	Delete Pane: delete the current pane.
 *	Search: pops a dialogue box for searching text in the file
 *	On the OK callback of the dialogue box
 *		search the string.
 *		if found show in current pane
 *		else pop up dialogue box again.
 *
 */

/*
 * Implementation notes.
 *
 * There is a data structure of type View that encapsulates
 * all information relative to each top level shell in the application
 * A View contains: the shell id, the panedwindow id, the file descriptor,
 * the number of panes, the file selection box id, 
 * 
 * This data structure is allocated at shell creation time
 * and passed around as client data to the callbacks or as the userdata
 * of the widgets.
 * 
 * For each pane in the paned window, there is one Pane data structure.
 * THIS PROGRAM IS NOT REALLY INTERNATONALIZED.
 *  LABELS ARE IN ENNGLISH

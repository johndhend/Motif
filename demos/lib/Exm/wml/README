The Exm.wml file in this directory includes all the supported exm
widgets provided in the release.  This file and the Imakefile also
demonstrate how a user can define their own widgets and put them
into wml for use with uil.

Note that this directory also contains a modified copy of wmldbcreate.c
which is necessary for the creation of the wml output file (.wmd) for
use with uil.

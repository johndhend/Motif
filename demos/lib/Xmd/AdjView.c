/*******************************************************************
   The following code is aimed at constraining the work_window size
   in an AUTOMATIC scrolledwindow so that it never becomes smaller
   than the view, in other word, so that you can never see the clipwindow
   background.
   First there are two callback/handler routines and then the convenience
   function that installs them on the clip and work window.

/* This macro is part of the trait and is used for the following situation
   DialogShells always mimic the child position on themselves.
   If the SetValues on a bb child position was 0,
   which is always the _current_ position of the bb in a DialogShell,
   Xt does not see a change and therefore not trigerred a geometry request.
   So BB (or any dialogShellSavvy child) has to catch this case
   and change the position request to use a special value in its
   SetValues method, XmDIALOG_SAVVY_FORCE_ORIGIN, to notify the Dialog that 
   it really wants to move in 0 */

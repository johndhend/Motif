TOP NEWS

  * for freeBSD 12.2 with Xorg installed sans Xprint (not in Xorg in 12.2)

  * 64 bit build, remade simple 'weatherable ' Makefiles, just several seconds
    to make + install with demos.

  * panner now has zoom in/out, trimmed down, stability improved

  * also has imake cf build working w/quats outside of X tree, but suggest
    as not mainstream (not weatherable, tends to break due to OS changes)

  * also "read to install" for freeBSD 12.2 amd64 (make install only)

NEWS

openMotif-2.1.30
openMotif-2.2.3  (nearly same as 2.1.30)
openMotif-2.3.4  (some fixes from)
openMotif-2.2.5  (per say, but name is 2.5.0, see version naming below)

  Panner support is back, and is optional (can un-#define)

  Panner support is back, a non-vurtual compatible panner with added feature
    (OpenGroup deleted previous Virtual Panning before public release 2.1+)
    See: demos/programs/panner/panner.man

  * NEW panner can now Zoom in / out and resize all work together
  * NEW panner now more stable and trim than first release
  * panner(1) does edge panning (pan by mouse to edge of screen)
    edge panning did not need to be in mwm and is non-virtual
  * panner updates smoother without flashing it can animate (server side draw)
  * mwm panner support sees/pans all trasients (popups)
    and icons (although icon policy may change situationally)
  * this release is intented to be "a more weather resisant release"
    for using mwm as a window manager, meaning no cf (yet).
    see notes on why cf is fragile in issues section.  it is NOT aimed
    at providing a developer base.   See more below.
  * 2.2.3 redhat bug slow help open and wrong size problem fixed.
    it was a Xt 5 sec waiting on ICCC call due to hacked defaults.
    Now default is "yes support".  Still off by default in many
    automake Motif releases.  "polling" is also eliminated.

  from 2.1.30 to 2.3.4 Motif has barely changed except in lib/Xm lib/Mrm

  2.2.3 (thus 2.5.0) does not include the newer jpeg+fontconfig+international
  support from 2.3.4 libXm, thus also has less "lib depends headaches"

  ./localdef.h is added for making certain defaults easy to edit.  if ADD_PAN
    is Not defined: defines reverts to verbatim motif-2.0.2 (approx. 2.3.4)
  ./config.h is still around, side effect of autoconfig

---------
New mwmrc settings and .Xdefaults settings

By default panner is "active" and uses Alt-Arrow.  Settings are optional.
The panner demo has been re-vived and can drag windows in a view with mouse,
also for remote desktops.

FILE: .Xdefaults

Mwm*panScrollX : 	25
Mwm*panScrollY : 	25
Mwm*usePan :		True
Mwm*panUseX :		False  ! try True
Mwm*panUseMwm :		False

! default is use Mwm if pcd win, X if not
! useMwm uses mwm or nothin, useX uses X on all but does use Mwm
! useX should do all Mwm things w/o un-necessary code like resize checking

FILE: .mwmrc
! pan desktop by panScrollXY ammount

Keys DefaultKeyBindings
{
        Alt<Key>Up              root|window|icon        f.north
        Alt<Key>Down            root|window|icon        f.south
        Alt<Key>Right           root|window|icon        f.east
        Alt<Key>Left            root|window|icon        f.west
}


  About cf/
    They are too old to be useful on freeBSD 12.2
    The autoconfig release can also do imake build on linux
    using cf Motif-X11.cf.tar.gz (using X11R6 installed not Xorg)



--------------
Why use mwm?

  there's probably a book on it

  * you need lightweight yet reliable yet better than twm, or for nastalgia
  * you have lib issues and need somethig not tied into BIG TECH desktops

  Mwm:
	* well made and tested
	* transparent remote desktop support if needed
	* Motif has no lib dependancies outside of X11 ... better than
          twm and seems to work when all else is broken or not installed
	* (free) gui development toolkits for smart ui layout / application
	  making for Motif (like java ide or xcode but not feature competitive)
	* Motif has free + in-print books if you need help
	* some older apps work nicer (or dont crash or fub) using Motif
	* easier security (yet not as secure as twm)
	* good for developers - who don't want desk clutter and do use xterm

  Caveats:
	* not easy to get a point/click developer environment that works
	  with motif - though some old ones may exist
	* not android emulating, though maybe one runs in a window?
	* CDE desktop and Motif work together as a pair (not this 250 release)

---------
CHANGELOG

  * tools/mwl clients/uil reworked so that changes to motif.wml "really work"
    (automake distros use stale files and work only if never changed)
    and a minor fix to add a ';' in Uil.y knocked out by some past patch
    'HaL fix CR 5427' incorreclty applied, is my guess.

  * panner more stable

  * this is a freeBSD 12.2 release for Xorg so it is by default without
    DtPrint as Xorg canceled libXp for freeBSD (#undef NO_XP in localdef.h
    to enable -lXp, move directory wml.print/ to wml/ because motif.wml,
    should work).  for config cf build also edit config/cf/host.def NO_XP.

  * many very minor compilation changes, and spaces and ifdefs
    most clang warnings handled, a few checked ones skipped

  * the linux motif-2.5.0 release on www.sourceforge.org, but it is only
    for Xfree86-4.8.0 and uil "can't be modified" but ... The pan250
    linux versions does not rebuild uil/wml uil/callable or msg translation
    and contains less fixes othersie; it is ok but not as good

-----------
KNOWN compile warnings:

  * Many pointless clang warnings that are not true when running unix / intel.
    Are int and pointer the same size?  They are and should be unless
    hacking driver code - and driver hackers turn off warnings.
  * Motif now has many spurious ones (very likey due to lack of type-casting)
    (for linux they were all checked - for clang not yet, shoudl be same)
  * Exm.h:16:52: warning: missing terminating ' character
    not a parse problem: is complaining of ' in license comment of Exm.wml
  * UilLexPars.h:222:1: warning: "VERSION" redefined
    is complaining of intentional #undef - warning text is incorrect

-----------
KNOWN issues:

  * imake build's install does not have de-install.  it is not the default
    build however.

  * there is no effort to support or suppress CDE

  * no, i don't know how your existing motif apps react to 64 bit compile
    i know the demos, 64 compiled, still work

  * if you click to enable "edge panning"
    and if leave your desk while it's panning, you'll never
    find your windows (miles away).  just restart mwm.  see man page.

  * make install-demos is not suggested - copy a few maybe if you use them.
    the cf build can maybe make demos "buildable outside the x tree" in so
    much as they can find their resources after being built (ie, filemanager
    cannot, crashes silenty and why is resources not found)
    I do not suggest attempting an "imake cf build so that demos install",
    the reality is: a good motif app can build and find it's resources without
    cf and still outside x-tree; crashing is a bug.

  * Not aimed at developing new motif applications.  Motif is no longer
    being developed and xorg no longer allow "imake or cf".

  * to build QUATS just enter in tests/ as the last SUBDIRS = in Imakefile
    it was tested to complete build error, yes

  * Motif internally does things like cut&paste tranfers 32bit (literal in
    many code places) though it supports 8-64 "from the outside".

  * Xorg also has not released any "CARD64" "CARD128", while removing some
    powerful X11 features and destroying compatibily (ie, XCB wrappers
    required to be hacked in to all apps but not Motif?  hmmm)
    This is fine for newer apps which can use new features, not good for
    updating any older apps which ... "alredy have their ways set in"

  * imake build only: be wary of depends re-build v. header changes.
    openMotif was hacked before release to build by automake and maintainers
    did not update imake files but also never finished quats auto makefiles.
    .c are in imake but .h may not be, the build will work but be cautious of
    a RE-BUILD (ie, touch *.c if you suspect it)

  * the "depends" build for imake is very slow and the cf build is not
    perfect.  better to do a whole build; much faster and more reliable.
    (that's true for most compiling kits also microsoft; not just imake cf)

---------
What is non-virtual panner?

  Sometimes virtual means "in hardware" and nasty effects of supported
  screen video lib hacks switching displays.  This panner doesn't fuss
  around and gets it all done by simply requesting windows move using
  the Motif or X function for asking.  It lacks hardware acceleration
  but that can be a good thing - less needy and buggy.


---------
Version naming 2.5.0 2.0.5
Version naming : accoring to automake libtool manual and ld.so

  ! DON'T FEED THE TROLLS !

  libXm.so.2.0.2 , .so.2.0, .so.2

    2  means the uppermost supported major number: what most apps "require"
       current version
    .0 means motif 1 or 0 apps are also (mostly) supported to load this
       age (supported span span of versions)
    .5 is an (arbitrary) revision of 2, but apps should avoid demanding it
       revision (revisions number, not effecting version)

    2.1.2 means, to ld.so, interface has changed, ld.so will refuse to load
    apps seeking "motif 2" saying 2.0 is not supported (file renaming aside)

    automake reorders this to libtool order 2.5.0 and makes 2.5.0.tar.gz,
    creating the inner tarname motif-2.5.0.tar.gz by default
      if you remake all: 2.5.0 is what gets made
      but this means libMrm.so.2.0.5 will be installed (in linux)

  HOWEVER - with cancel culture around, Xorg removed DtPrint so if versioning
    wasn't wrong enough how do we notate a re-release against a non-X X?
    My answer:  don't feed the trolls.  Leave it be.  Is small and quick
    to install and uninstall it doesn't need poly-versional support.

    added many fixes from 2.3.4 but did not include new libXm-2.3.4 
      instead i wish to make "2.3.5" a separate release
      because i know many apps worked with 2.1.30/2.2.3 and cannot
      say the same for any new revision (for me 223 compiles 234 didnt)

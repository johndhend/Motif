#) This is the DNDDrop2 test.

C)


#) There should be a topLevel window with title \"topLevel0\"
   containing six PushButtons arranged in two rows, and a Text
   widget, within a BulletinBoard.

#) PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been registered as SIMPLE
   dropSites and BulletinBoard has been registered as COMPOSITE
   dropSite.

#) Move \"topLevel0\" so that the control panel is fully visible.
   The control panel should contain four optionMenus for modifying
   animationStyle, dropActivity, dropSiteOperations, and 
   dragOperations. The control panel should also contain an 
   optionMenu \"Apply Changes To\" for applying the changes in
   animationStyle, dropActivity, and dropSiteOperations, to the 
   either the SIMPLE dropSites, or the COMPOSITE dropSite, or
   both.

#) The \"Animation Style\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"HighLight\", \"ShadowOut\", \"ShadowIn\", \"None\", and
   \"Pixmap\". \"Pixmap\" is insensitive. \"Highlight\" is the
   selected item at startup.


#) The \"Drop Activity\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Active\",\"Inactive\" and \"Ignore"\. \"Active\" is the selected item
   at startup.

#) The \"Drop Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", and \"All\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Drag Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", and \"All\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Apply Changes To\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"PushButtons\", \"BulletinBoard\", and \"Both\". \"PushButtons\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) If you want to run another DND test simultaneously and do not
   care about the instructions of that test, run that test with 
   the option -u "-noinstruct". Otherwise, before proceeding 
   further you will have to reposition the control panels, the 
   topLevel windows, and the instruction panels of both the tests
   so that they are all completely visible.

C)


#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns. A dragIcon should 
   appear consisting of a runner, an open folder, and an arrowhead.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget.

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   you should not see any visual change.

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0, PushBtn2, or PushBtn4,
   the borders of those PushBtns should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, the borders of
   the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the BulletinBoard but outside of
   PushBtn0, PushBtn2, PushBtn4, and the Text widget, the borders of
   the BulletinBoard should get highlighted.

#) Move the pointer over to rootWindow and release BTransfer. The
   dragIcon should snap back to from where the drag was initiated
   and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"ShadowIn\" from the \"Animation Style\" menu.

   pointer positioned on any of the PushBtns and start dragging.
   
#) Now, when the pointer is being dragged over PushBtn0, PushBtn2,
   and PushBtn4, the dragUnder effect should be displayed by an 
   inset shadow.

#) When the pointer is being dragged over other PushBtns or the
   BulletinBoard outside of all the PushBtns and Text widget, the
   borders of the BulletinBoard should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, the borders of
   the Text widget should get highlighted.

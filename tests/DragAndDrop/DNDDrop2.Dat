#) This is the DNDDrop2 test.

C)


#) There should be a topLevel window with title \"topLevel0\"
   containing six PushButtons arranged in two rows, and a Text
   widget, within a BulletinBoard.

#) PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been registered as SIMPLE
   dropSites and BulletinBoard has been registered as COMPOSITE
   dropSite.

#) Move \"topLevel0\" so that the control panel is fully visible.
   The control panel should contain four optionMenus for modifying
   animationStyle, dropActivity, dropSiteOperations, and 
   dragOperations. The control panel should also contain an 
   optionMenu \"Apply Changes To\" for applying the changes in
   animationStyle, dropActivity, and dropSiteOperations, to the 
   either the SIMPLE dropSites, or the COMPOSITE dropSite, or
   both.

#) The \"Animation Style\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"HighLight\", \"ShadowOut\", \"ShadowIn\", \"None\", and
   \"Pixmap\". \"Pixmap\" is insensitive. \"Highlight\" is the
   selected item at startup.


#) The \"Drop Activity\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Active\",\"Inactive\" and \"Ignore"\. \"Active\" is the selected item
   at startup.

#) The \"Drop Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", and \"All\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Drag Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", and \"All\". \"Move_n_Copy\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Apply Changes To\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"PushButtons\", \"BulletinBoard\", and \"Both\". \"PushButtons\"
   is the selected item at startup.

#) If you want to run another DND test simultaneously and do not
   care about the instructions of that test, run that test with 
   the option -u "-noinstruct". Otherwise, before proceeding 
   further you will have to reposition the control panels, the 
   topLevel windows, and the instruction panels of both the tests
   so that they are all completely visible.

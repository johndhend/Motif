#) This is the DNDIcon1 test.

C)


#) There should be a topLevel window with title \"topLevel0\"
   containing six PushButtons arranged in two rows, and a Text
   widget, within a BulletinBoard.

#) PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been registered as
   dropSites.

#) Move \"topLevel0\" so that the control panel is fully visible.

#) There should be a control panel containing ten optionMenus
   for modifying respectively, animationStyle, dropActivity, 
   dropSiteOperations, dragOperations, blendModel,
   cursorForeground, cursorBackground, validCursorForeground,
   invalidCursorForeground, and noneCursorForeground. The control
   panel should also show a PushButton \"ApplyChanges\" for 
   applying the changes in animationStyle, dropActivity, and 
   dropSiteOperations, to the registered dropSites.

#) The \"Animation Style\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"HighLight\", \"ShadowOut\", \"ShadowIn\", \"None\", and
   \"Pixmap\". \"Pixmap\" is insensitive. \"Highlight\" is the
   selected item at startup.


#) The \"Drop Activity\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Active\" and \"Inactive\". \"Active\" is the selected item
   at startup.

#) The \"Drop Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", \"All\", and \"None\". 
   \"Move_n_Copy\" is the selected item at startup.

#) The \"Drag Operations\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"Move_n_Copy\", \"MoveOnly\", \"CopyOnly\", \"LinkOnly\",
   \"Move_n_Link\", \"Copy_n_Link\", \"All\", and \"None\". 
   \"CopyOnly\" is the selected item at startup.

C)


#) The \"Blend Model\" optionMenu should show the options,
   \"All\", \"State_n_Source\", \"JustSource\", and \"None\".

#) The \"Cursor Foreground\", \"Cursor Background\",
   \"Valid Cursor Foreground\", \"Invalid Cursor Foreground\",
   and the \"None Cursor Foreground\" optionMenus all should 
   show the options, \"Red\", \"Black\", \"Yellow\", \"Green\",
   and \"White\". \"Cursor Background\" has \"White\" as the
   selected item at startup; all others have \"Red\" as the
   selected item at startup.

#) If you want to run another DND test simultaneously and do not
   care about the instructions of that test, run that test with 
   the option -u "-noinstruct". Otherwise, before proceeding 
   further you will have to reposition the control panels, the 
   topLevel windows, and the instruction panels of both the tests
   so that they are all completely visible.

C)


#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtn1. 
   
#) A dragIcon should appear consisting of three squares with white
   background and red text in the foreground. The topleft square 
   should have \"SRC ICON\" in the middle, with \"SRC\" on
   one line and \"ICON\" on another line. The top right square
   should have \"NONE ICON\" in the middle, with \"NONE\" on one
   line and \"ICON\" on another line. And the bottom right
   square ahould have \"COPY ICON\" in the middle with \"COPY\"
   on one line and \"ICON\" on another line. All three should be
   completely visible.

#) The attachment for the operationCursorIcon (bottom right
   square) is SouthEast and for the stateCursorIcon (top right
   square) is NorthEast. The top left square is the 
   sourceCursorIcon.

#) Note that the hotspot for the dragIcon comes from the state
   Icon, which is the topleft corner of the square when the
   state is None (meaning when you are dragging over widgets
   which are not registered as dropSites).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget.

#) When the pointer is moving within PuishBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   or within the Bulletinboard but outside of all the PushBtns and
   the text widget, you should not see any visual feedback. The 
   dragIcon should be the same as when you initiated the drag with 
   pointer on PushBtn1, meaning, it should show that you are dragging
   over widgets that are not registered dropSites.

#) When the pointer is moving over PushBtn2, you should not see any
   visual dragUnder effect. But the stateIcon (top right square) 
   part of the dragIcon should show \"INVALID ICON\", instead of 
   \"NONE ICON\".The reason for this is that, even though PushBtn2 
   is registered as a dropSite, it is not registered to accept any 
   drops (importTargets is NULL and numImportTargets is 0).

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0 or PushBtn4, or the
   Text widget, the borders of those PushBtns or the Text widget 
   should get highlighted. Also, the stateIcon (the top right square)
   should change to \"VALID ICON\", and the hotspot should shift to 
   the left midpoint of that square.

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"Inactive\" from the \"Drop Activity\" menu and click
   on \"ApplyChanges\" to apply this new dropActivity to all the
   registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default) with the 
   pointer positioned on PushBtn1 and start dragging.
   
#) Now, except the Text widget, wherever you drag inside the 
   BulletinBoard, the stateIcon should show \"NONE ICON\",
   meaning, even the registered dropSites are treated as 
   non-dropSites when dropActivity is \"Inactive\".

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Select \"Active\" from the \"Drop Activity\" menu and click
   on \"ApplyChanges\" to apply this new dropActivity to all the
   registered PushBtn dropSites.

#) Now, initiate drag from PushBtn1, and drag over all the PushBtns.
   The stateIcon should show that the behavior is back to when
   we started, meaning, PushBtn0, PushBtn4, and the Text widget are
   Valid dropSites, PushBtn2 is an Invalid dropSite, and all other
   PushBtns and the BulletinBoard are non-dropSites.

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

C)


#) Select \"State_n_Source\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Initiate drag from PushBtn1. The dragIcon should now consist of
   only two squares, the one on the left (sourceCursorIcon) showing
   \"SRC ICON\", and the one on the right (stateCursorIcon) showing
   \"NONE ICON\".

#) Release BTransfer with pointer over PushBtn3. The dragIcon should
   zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Select \"JustSource\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Initiate drag from PushBtn1. The dragIcon should now consist of
   only one square (sourceCursorIcon) showing \"SRC ICON\".

#) Start dragging with BTransfer pressed, on different PushBtns. Note
   the hotspot has now shifted to the topleft corner of the dragIcon.
   Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Select \"None\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Initiate drag from PushBtn1. There should be no dragIcon visible
   now. But as you drag the pointer with BTransfer pressed, the
   state should be visible through dragUnder effect, i.e., while you
   are dragging over PushBtn0, PushBtn4, or the text widget, you
   should see that the borders of these widgets get highlighted.

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard.

C)


#) Select \"All\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Select "Red" from the \"Cursor ForeGround\" menu and 
   "Yellow" from the \"Cursor Background\" menu and initiate drag. 
   You should see that all parts of the dragIcon have red foreground
   and yellow background. Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on 
   the BulletinBoard. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and 
   disappear.

#) Select "Black" from the \"Valid Cursor Foreground\" menu, 
   "Green" from the \"Invalid Cursor Foreground\" menu, and "Green" 
   from the \"None Cursor Foreground\" menu. You will see that these 
   will affect foreground of all parts of the dragIcon depending on
   where you are dragging.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer with the pointer over any of
   the PushBtns. With BTransfer pressed, drag over various PushBtns
   and the Text widget.

#) When you are dragging over PushBtn0 and PushBtn4 or the Text widget, 
   you will notice that the state icon shows \"VALID ICON\" with black
   foreground and yellow background.

#) When you are dragging over PushBtn2 , you will notice that the state
   icon shows \"INVALID ICON\" with green foreground and yellow 
   background.

#) When you are dragging over any other PushBtn or over BulletinBoard 
   outside of all the PushBtns and the Text widget, you will notice 
   that the state icon shows \"NONE ICON\" with green foreground and 
   yellow background.

#) Release BTransfer with the dragIcon on the BulletinBoard. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1 and disappear.

#) Repeat steps 3 through 8 for different color selections.

C)

!) This tests for CR 5937.  PushBtn0-PushBtn3 have increased
   in size to ensure that they are contiguous (i.e. no 
   BulletinBoard space exists between them).

#) Select \"JustSource\" from the \"Blend Model\" menu.

#) Select \"Black\" from the \"Cursor Background\" menu,
   \"Red\" from the \"Valid Cursor Foreground\" menu,
   \"Green\" from the \"Invalid Cursor Foreground\" menu, and
   \"Yellow\" from the \"None Cursor Foreground\" menu.

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn1.
   With BTransfer pressed, drag over PushBtn0.  The cursor foreground
   should change to red.

#) Keeping BTransfer pressed, drag over PushBtn2.  The cursor foreground
   should change to green.

#) Keeping BTransfer pressed, drag back over PushBtn0.  If the cursor does
   not change back to red, CR 5937 has not been fixed.

C)

E)

#) This is the DNDtest2 test.

C)


#) There should be two topLevel windows with titles \"topLevel0\"
   and \"topLevel1\", each containing six PushButtons arranged in
   two rows, and a Text widget, within a BulletinBoard.

#) In each topLevel, PushBtn0, PushBtn2, and PushBtn4 have been 
   registered as dropSites.

#) If you want to run another DND test simultaneously and do not
   care about the instructions of that test, run that test with 
   the option -u "-noinstruct". Otherwise, before proceeding 
   further you will have to reposition the control panels, the 
   topLevel windows, and the instruction panels of both the tests
   so that they are all completely visible.

C)


#) Move the pointer to PushBtn1, topLevel0. 

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default). A dragIcon
   should appear consisting of a runner, two open folders, and an 
   arrowhead.

#) With BTransfer pressed, move the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget, inside topLevel0.

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   topLevel0, you should not see any visual change since these are not
   registered as dropSites.

#) When the pointer is moving over PushBtn2, topLevel0, you should not
   see any visual change. The reason for this is that, even though 
   PushBtn2, topLevel0 is registered as a dropSite, it is not 
   registered to accept any drops (importTargets is NULL and 
   numImportTargets is 0).

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0 or PushBtn4, topLevel0,
   the borders of those PushBtns should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, topLevel0, the 
   borders of the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the BulletinBoard, topLevel0, but
   outside of all the PushBtns and the Text widget, there should be no
   visual change.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer on the root window outside the
   topLevel windows. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1,
   topLevel0, and disappear.

C)


#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel0.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or
   PushBtn5, topLevel0. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1, 
   topLevel0, and disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel0.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn2, topLevel0. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1, topLevel0, and disappear.

C)


#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel0.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over the BulletinBoard, 
   topLevel0, but outside of all the PushBtns and the Text widget. 
   The dragIcon should again zap back to PushBtn1, topLevel0, and
   disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel0.

#) Now, release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn0 or PushBtn4,
   topLevel0. The dragIcon should melt into the background and 
   disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel0.

#) Now, release BTransfer with the pointer over the Text widget,
   topLevel0.  The text \"return value\" should get inserted into the
   Text widget and the dragIcon should melt into the background and 
   disappear.

C)


#) Move the pointer to PushBtn1, topLevel1. 

#) Initiate Drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default). A dragIcon
   should appear consisting of a runner, two open folders, and an 
   arrowhead.

#) With BTransfer pressed, move the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget, inside topLevel1.

#) When the pointer is moving within PuishBtn1, PushBtn3, or PushBtn5,
   topLevel1, you should not see any visual change since these are not
   registered as dropSites.

#) When the pointer is moving over PushBtn2, topLevel1, you should not
   see any visual change. The reason for this is that, even though 
   PushBtn2, topLevel1, is registered as a dropSite, it is not 
   registered to accept any drops (importTargets is NULL and 
   numImportTargets is 0).

#) When the pointer is moving within PushBtn0 or PushBtn4, topLevel1,
   the borders of those PushBtns should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the Text widget, topLevel1, the 
   borders of the Text widget should get highlighted.

#) When the pointer is moving within the BulletinBoard, topLevel1, but
   outside of all the PushBtns and the Text widget, there should be no
   visual change.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer on the root window outside the
   topLevel windows. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1,
   topLevel1, and disappear.

C)


#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel1.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn1, PushBtn3, or
   PushBtn5, topLevel1. The dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1, 
   topLevel1, and disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel1.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn2, topLevel1. The
   dragIcon should zap back to PushBtn1, topLevel1, and disappear.

C)


#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel1.

#) Release BTransfer with the pointer over the BulletinBoard, 
   topLevel1, but outside of all the PushBtns and the Text widget. 
   The dragIcon should again zap back to PushBtn1, topLevel1, and
   disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel1.

#) Now, release BTransfer with the pointer over PushBtn0 or PushBtn4,
   topLevel1. The dragIcon should melt into the background and 
   disappear.

#) Again initiate the Drag by pressing BTransfer with pointer over
   PushBtn1, topLevel1.

#) Now, release BTransfer with the pointer over the Text widget,
   topLevel1.  The text \"return value\" should get inserted into the
   Text widget and the dragIcon should melt into the background and 
   disappear.

C)

#) Now, let us try Drag and Drop between dropSites within different
   topLevel windows.

#) Move the pointer over to PushBtn1, topLevel0.

#) Initiate the drag by pressing BTransfer. The same dragIcon should
   appear as in previous cases.

#) With BTransfer pressed, move the pointer over different PushBtns
   and over the Text widget, inside topLevel1.

#) Again, let us try Drag and Drop between dropSites within different
   topLevel windows, but the other way round, this time.

#) Move the pointer over to PushBtn1, topLevel1.

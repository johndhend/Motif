#) This is the DNDList1 test.

#) This is just to test the DND support in the Motif List widget.
   To test this, you need to run another Motif client with an
   editable Text(Field) widget in it.

#) Position the pointer on the item \"PushButton\" in the list. 
   Initiate drag by pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text
   widget, and release BTransfer. The text \"PushButton\" should
   appear in the Text widget.

#) Select \"DrawnButton\", \"Label\", \"ArrowButton\" items in the
   List by clicking MouseButton1 on these items.

#) Initiate drag with the pointer positioned on one of these 
   selected items and pressing BTransfer.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text widget,
   and release BTransfer. Three items \"DrawnButton\", \"Label\"
   and \"ArrowButton\" should appear in the Text widget on three
   consecutive lines.

#) Initiate drag by pressing BTransfer with the pointer over the
   item \"Separator\" in the List.

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text widget,
   and release BTransfer. This time, only the text \"Separator\"
   should appear new in the Text widget.

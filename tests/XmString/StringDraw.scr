# #) This is the StringDraw test to test XmStringDraw.

# #) You should see a BulletinBoard containing an empty DrawingArea 
#   widget of size 300x200.

# #) There should be four lines showing the same string 
#    "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING", in font "9x15bold" (or "fixed" if 
#    "9x15bold" is not available), with different levels of 
#    clipping taking place.

# #) Line 1 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" complete.

# #) Line 2 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" with some
#    horizontal clipping, meaning, some of the characters should be
#    clipped off.

# #) Line 3 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" complete
#    in the horizontal direction, but with characters getting clipped
#    in height.

# #) Line 4 should show the string "TEST STRING FOR CLIPPING" with
#    both horizontal and vertical clipping.

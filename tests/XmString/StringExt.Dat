@) StringExt tests the XmString functions which get dimension information 
for displaying XmStrings. The values returned from the XmString functions
are compared against the values returned from the function XTextExtent().

#) A blank drawing area widget should be displayed.
#) Click MB1 in the drawing area widget. The strings \"X is an Example of Z\"
and \"Z is an Example of X\" should now be displayed in the drawing area widget.
A rectangle is drawn around each string where the dimensions of the rectangle
are the dimensions returned from XmStringExtent(). Verify that the rectangles
represent the smallest bounding box which encloses each string.
#) Tables have been printed to stdout which list the functions called
and the dimensions returned from each function for the given string. 
A message will then be printed indicating whether each XmString function
passed or failed. If your term window is small, you may need to scroll
in order to see all the text.

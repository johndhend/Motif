# HISTORY

#  An XmString is created with direction, charset, text and separator
#  components.  The function XmStringGetNextComponent() is then called
#  to traverse the XmString and retrieve each component along with
#  its values.  The component types and values should be printed
#  to stdout.

#  Verify that the following values are printed:

# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_DIRECTION: XmSTRING_DIRECTION_R_TO_L
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_CHARSET: ISO8859-1
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TEXT: This is a test.
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR: True
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR: True
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR: True
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_DIRECTION: XmSTRING_DIRECTION_L_TO_R
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_CHARSET: ISO8859-1
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TEXT: This is only a test.

# C)

#  The function XmCvtXmStringToCT() is called to convert the
#  XmString to a (char *) string in compound text format.
#  The converted string should be printed to stdout. 

#  Verify that the following string is printed:

# @) 2]This is a test.

# @) 1]This is only a test.

#  There should be two blank lines between the lines of text.

#  The function XmCvtCTToXmString() is then called to convert the
#  (char *) string in compound text format to an XmString.
#  XmStringGetNextComponent() is then called to traverse the XmString
#  and retrieve each of the components and their values.
#  The components obtained and their values should be printed to stdout.

#  Verify that the following values are printed:

# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_DIRECTION: XmSTRING_DIRECTION_R_TO_L
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_CHARSET: ISO8859-1
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TEXT: This is a test.
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR: True
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR: True
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_SEPARATOR: True
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_DIRECTION: XmSTRING_DIRECTION_L_TO_R
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_CHARSET: ISO8859-1
# @) XmSTRING_COMPONENT_TEXT: This is only a test.

#  The component types and component values are then compared
#  to the component types and values in the original XmString.
#  A message will be printed to stdout indicating whether
#  XmCvtCTToXmString() passed or failed based on these
#  comparison tests.

There are 2 different kinds of tests in this directory:

1. For testing display of text using different Locale, through the i18n1 script

   The i18n1 script should be run using the following syntax:

       i18n1 <locale-name> <test_case>

       where locale-name can be one of the following:
			 american, french, hebrew, japanese, japanese.euc

			 It is used to define the LANG environment variable,
			 which is system dependent. So you will have to modify
			 the script if it does not support your operating
			 system.

             test_case can be a or b. 

		         a is just displaying text.
			 b is also doing a conversion of the text value of
                           Text1 to wide char and displays it in Text2.

2. For testing Input Method.

   InputMethod1 is testing shared Input Context, between a ScrolledText, a Text
		and a TextField.

   InputMethod2 is testing per widget Input Contexts.


   These tests can be run using the following -u options:

	 a for trying to get connected to an OVER_THE_SPOT Input Method,
	 b for an OFF_THE_SPOT Input Method,
	 c for a ROOT Input Method.

#) This is the PIMwmHints test.

C)


#) There should now be a pushbutton displayed in a window that shows
   a yellow background and red letters that say \"TEST 1 BTN 1\".

#) The decorations on the pushbutton window should be only a title bar.

#) The keyboard input focus and pointer focus should both be set
   to the pushbutton.

#) Click the pointer on the pushbutton to reset the input focus to be
   application modal. A confirmation message should appear in the standard
   output window.

C)


#) The pushbutton window's decorations should now include the system menu
   button, and the minimize button. There should NOT be a maximize button
   or resize handles.

#) Also, the system menu should have all the normal items EXCEPT:  Move,
   Maximize and Close.

C)


#) The pushbutton window's decorations should now revert to the default
   of all, which includes the border, resize handles, title, system menu,
   minimize and maximize buttons.

#) The system menu should also contain all the default functions.

#) The input mode for the pushbuttons is now MODELESS - the default.

C)


#) There should now be two windows, each with a pushbutton in it. Both
   windows should have a border, a maximize button, a minimize button,
   a system menu button, and a title bar, but NO resize handles.

#) Also, the system menu should have all the normal entries EXCEPT for
   the \"Close\" item.

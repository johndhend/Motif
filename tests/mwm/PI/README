DESCRIPTION:

This directory contains tests of the OSF/Motif Window Manager (mwm)
Programmatic Interface.  It is assumed that the latest version of mwm
is running (found in ../../../clients/mwm/mwm).  All of the tests are
interactive, and include displayed user instructions where needed.  The
remaining tests create and display widgets, including a MessageBox
widget which displays instructions and a summary message.

The test PINames is run from within a script called "run_PINames." See
below for details.

The PIProto test does not currently test the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF or the
WM_TAKE_FOCUS properties.

The script run_PINames runs the command 'machine' to decide what type
of machine it is running on.  If this command is not available on your
platform, or if your platform is a version of System V, but not the
hp300 machine, modify the script appropriately.  Also, the run_PINames
script will print a message at the end that says something like
"run_PINames: 21326 Killed" with a different number before "killed".
This is normal and not to be concerned with.  Confirm that the above
script has execute permission before attempting any tests that use
them.

			test, restore the old resource database, and restart

COMPILATION:

To compile all of these tests, type either "make"
or "make all".

To compile individual tests:

PIHints		- "make PIHints PIHints.uid"

PIIconSt	- "make PIIconSt PIIconSt.uid"

PIMwmHints	- "make PIMwmHints PIMwmHints.uid"

PIMwmInfo	- "make PIMwmInfo PIMwmInfo.uid"

PINames		- "make PINames PINames.uid"

PIProto		- "make PIProto PIProto.uid"

PIColormap	- "make PIColormap PIColormap.uid"


EXECUTION:

To run any of these tests (except PINames), simply type the name of
the test, e.g.

% PIHints

The test PINames requires the window manager to be restarted after new
resource are added to the database.  To do this, there is a run script
that will handle all the saving, starting, restoring and restarting.  So,
to run the PINames test, run the script as follow:

% run_PINames

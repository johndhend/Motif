#) This is the PIIconSt test.

#) Make sure that the keyboardFocusPolicy for mwm is 'pointer' before
   continuing.

C)


#) There should now be a pushbutton displayed in a window that shows
   a yellow background and red letters that say \"TEST 1 BTN 1\".

C)


#) The pushbutton window should now be iconified.

C)


#) The pushbutton window should now be normalized again.

C)

#) The pushbutton window should now be iconified again. 

#) Move the pointer over to the icon (if there is iconBox, you may have
   to scroll first to make the icon visible). When the pointer is over 
   the icon you should see the icon label to be "TestPIR3720" with the
   string "Test" on the top line and the string "PIR3720" on the second
   line. This is due to the fact that a newline character is embedded 
   in the IconName between "Test" and "PIR3720".

C)

#) The pushbutton window should now be deiconified and iconified again. 

#) Move the pointer over to the icon (if there is iconBox, you may have
   to scroll first to make the icon visible). When the pointer is over 
   the icon you should see the icon label to be "TestPIR3720" on a
   single line. In this case the IconName has a <CR> character
   embedded within the icon label between "Test" and "PIR3720".

C)

#) Move the pointer over to the iconified window and click mouse button1
   once. The window menu should get posted. Otherwise, PIR4040 has not been
   resolved. Then hit <Esc> to unpost the menu.

 * HISTORY
*/
#) This is the MwmUI4 test.
C)

#) 3 test windows should appear on your screen. They should
   be in a staggered layout : each window should be offset horizontally
   and vertically from the previous. 
#) The font used for the window menu and title string should be 8x13bold
#) The window with focus should have a red background and wheat foreground.
   These colors should be reversed in the windows without focus.
C)

#) This panel tests window decoration resources.
#) Try to move "TestWindow1" by pressing MB1 on the frame and dragging.
   You should not be able to do so; if you can, CR 5075 hasn't been fixed.
#) A dialog box should have appeared on the screen. It should have the
   a window menu button and a title. There should be no resize handles,
   and the resize operation should not be allowed.
#) Dismiss the dialog box by clicking on "Cancel".
#) There should be no maximize button on TestWindow1, and no 
   Maximize option in the window menu of TestWindow1.

C)   

#) This panel tests focus policies.
#) Iconify the "TestWindow2". Normalize it; it should have focus.
C)

#) This panel tests size and position resources.
#) Resize any test window. No resize cursors should appear whe you are within
   the bounds of the test window, but have not started the resize operation.
   However, the resize operation is allowed, and resize cursors should 
   appear when you resize the windows.
#) Initiate a move operation on any of the windows EXCEPT TestWindow1
   by pressing <Shift><Tab> on it. Note the position of the pointer : 
   It should not be warped to the center of the screen.
C)


#) This panel tests icon configuration resources.
#) Iconify all 3 test windows. The icon should line up from top to bottom
   along the right of the screen. The icon image should be "wingdogs".
#) Give focus to one of the icons. The label should still appear
   truncated.
C)

#) The next two panels tests various Mwm menus and key bindings, and the 
   Mwm functions that can be performed via the menus. 
#) Press MB3 on the root window. A menu entitled "TestMenu" should
   appear, with 2 items : "Refresh", "Pass Keys".
   The background of the menu should be steel blue, and the foreground, black.
   Release MB3 to unpost the menu.
#) Press <Shift><Tab> on any of the windows EXCEPT TestWindow1. 
   A move operation should be initiated. Now, choose "PassKeys" from the root 
   menu, and press <Shift><Tab> again. No move operation should be initiated. 
#) Repeat the sequence of steps in (3) a few times; the key binding for
   the move operation should toggle between being enabled and disabled.
#) Choose "Refresh" from the root menu; a refresh operation should be
   performed on the window.
C)

#) Maximize TestWindow2. Iconify it.
#) Choose "NormalizeRaise from the window menu. The window will be deiconfied
   to a normalized state, and raise to the top of the window stack.
#) Maximize and iconify TestWindow2 again. Choose "RestoreRaise" from the 
   window menu. The window will be restored to its maximized state and raised 
   to the top of the window stack.
#) Post the window menu of one of the test windows. 
#) Move the pointer to the window menu button of "TestWindow1". Double-click
   on it rapidly with MB1. The window should not close.

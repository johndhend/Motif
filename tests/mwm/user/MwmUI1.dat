#) This is the MwmUI1 test.

C)

#) You should see the string "THIS IS JUST A TEST STRING" in 9x15bold
   font.

C)

#) You should see the string "THIS IS JUST A TEST STRING" in 12x24
   font.

#) Move the MwmUI1 window to -200, 200.

C)

#) If the MwmUI1 window has disappeared from the display, either the
   enhancement to keep the window always visible on the screen has not
   been incorporated, or the added enhancement is buggy (PIR2939).

#) If the window is visible, you should see the same string
   "THIS IS JUST A TEST STRING" in 6x12 font.

C)

#) Irrespective of whether the window was visible with the previous
   instruction panel, you should now see the same string 
   "THIS IS JUST A TEST STRING" in courb24 (courier-bold-24) font.

C)

#) Resize the window to 500x500.

#) Move the window over so as to cover the iconBox.

#) Iconify the window.

#) Deiconify the window.

#) The window should get focus. If the window does not get focus until
   you move out and back into the window, PIR4141 has not been fixed.

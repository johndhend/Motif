#) Two windows should appear on the screen. One is just a shell titled 
   "TestWindow1". The other is a form dialog containing two pushbuttons, 
   "Make Child" and "Destroy Me".

#) Click on the "Make Child" pushbutton. This will create an additional 
   FormDialog with a "Make Child" pushbutton. Repeat this 2 more times,
   each time clicking on the "Make Child" pushbutton of the most recently
   created FormDialog.

#) In all subsequent intstructions, use MB3 to post the window menu rather
   than MB1.
   Move "TestWindow1" so that it obscures "Form3" and "Form4". You might need
   to post the window menu for "TestWindow1", and choose "Raise" to enable 
   "TestWindow1" to be stacked on top of the form dialogs.

#) Post the window menu for "Form2". Choose "Raise" from the window menu.
   The set of 4 form dialogs should be raised above "TestWindow1".

   enable "TestWindow1" to be stacked on top of the form dialogs.

#) Post the window menu for "Form2". Choose "Raise Within" from the window 
   menu. There should be no change.

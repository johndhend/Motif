 * HISTORY
*/

#) This is the MwmUI3 test.
#) There should be an iconBox on your screen.
#) The title of the iconBox should be MyIcons.
#) The iconBox should have 1 row and 4 columns. It should have a vertical
   scrollbar.
#) The title of the iconBox should be MyIcons.
#) Before continuing with the test, iconify all windows on the screen except
   for the test instruction panel.
C)

#) Four client windows should have appeared on the screen, each 
   containing a PushButton. The windows should be on top of one
   another, with their horizontal and vertical frames offset from the
   upper left corner of the screen.
#) None of the client windows should have focus.
#) The client windows should now have an offwhite frame. The title of
   the window should be should be in red.
#) Position the client windows so that they are all visible.
#) "TestWindow1" should have a matte 20 pixels wide. The matte should 
   be green, with a bottom shadow color of red, and a top shadow color of 
   blue. (the bottom shadow color is the bottom and right 3-dimesional bevel. 
   The top color is the top and left 3-dimensional bevel.) The 
   pattern of the top and left bevels should be diaganol lines slanting 
   to the right, alternating between blue and red. The pattern of the 
   bottom and right bevels should be diaganol lines slanting to the left, 
   also alternating between blue and red.
C)

#) This panel tests window decoration resources.
#) A dialog box should have appeared on the screen. It should have the
   default decorations, i.e a window menu button, a title, and resize handles.
   You should be able to perform any functions represented by those buttons,
   i.e post the window menu and resize it.
#) Dismiss the dialog box by pressing "Cancel".
C)   

#) This panel tests icon configuration resources.
#) Iconify "TestWindow1".
#) Click MB1 on the icon for "TestWindow1".  (You might have to scroll to it 
   if it isn't visible).   The menu will post but not stay posted.
#) Normalize "TestWindow1". Look at the icon for this window in the iconBox.
   It should be grayed out. (As should the icons of all the normalized
   windows on the screen.)
C)


#) This panel tests focus policies.
#) Move any test window over "TestWindow3". Click inside "TestWindow3". It
   should get the focus, but should not be raised.
#) Move any test window over "TestWindow4". Click inside "TestWindow4". It
   should get the focus, and should be raised.
#) The window with focus should have a red background, and wheat foreground.
#) Iconify "TestWindow1". No window should have the focus now.
   You should be able to set the focus on any window by explicitly 
   selecting it. 
#) Normalize "TestWindow1" by choosing "Restore" from the icon menu. 
   (You might have to scroll to it if it isn't visible).
   It shouldn't have the focus.
#) Close "TestWindow4" via the window menu. No window should have the 
   focus; if it does, CR 5213 hasn't been fixed.
C)

#) This panel tests size and position resources.
#) Try to resize "TestWindow1" bigger. It should let you resize it
   to any dimensions you want. You should be able to see the resize cursors.
   Return TestWindow1 to a normal size.
@) /* Read next 2 instructions before continuing. */
#) Maximize "TestWindow1" using the maximize button on the frame. It should 
   be maximized to the full dimensions of the screen.
#) Normalize "TestWindow1" via the window menu.
#) Press <Shift><Tab> on a window. You should be able to perform a move 
   operation. Use the arrow keys to move the window. Note the position of
   the pointer during the operation; it should be warped to the center of
   the selected window. 
#) Place the window. 
C)

#) This panel tests various Mwm functions, and the bindings associated with
   them.
#) There should be 5 windows on your screen : the 3 test windows, the 
   iconBox, and the instruction box.
   Stack the 3 test windows over each other. Give focus to the top window.
   press <Ctrl><Shift><Tab>. The window should be lowered to the bottom
   of the stack.
#) Press <Ctrl><Tab> on the window at the bottom of the stack.
   The window should be raised to the top of the stack.
#) Press MB3 on the root window. A menu titled "TestMenu" appears with
   the following items : "Shuffle Up", "Shuffle Down", "To Another Test Menu".
   There should be a separator between the  title and the items. The menu 
   background should be off-white, the foreground red, and the font courb24.
@) /* test for CR 5707 */
#) Select "To Another Test Menu" from the TestMenu menu. A menu titled
   "    CR5707Menu    " should be posted, with a single grayed-out item :
   "Do Nothing". If there are no triling spaces in the menu title,
   CR 5707 hasn't been fixed.
#)/* READ THE REST OF THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THIS PANEL BEFORE CARRYING OUT.*/
#) There should now be 5 windows on your screen : the 3 test windows, the 
   iconBox, and the instruction box. Stack all 5 windows on top of
   each other.
#) Press MB3 on the root menu. Select "Shuffle Down" from the
   TestMenu menu. The window at the top of the stack should be lowered to
   the bottom of the stack.
#) Give focus to the window on the bottom of the stack. Select "Shuffle Up" 
   from the TestMenu menu. at the bottom of the stack should be raised to the
   top.
#) If instuction box isn't visible, move it so that it is.
C)
      
#) Move the pointer to the window menu button of "TestWindow1". Double-click
   on it rapidly with MB1. The window should not close.

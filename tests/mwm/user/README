MWM Test Suite
--------------

This is a test suite which is designed to test all the 
resources and functions of mwm that can be tested by 
user-interface tests.

In this test suite, the mwm resources are tested by copying
different default files into the user's home directory and
then running the tests.  The tests are basically manual, 
although the setup is done using a C-shell script.

Information you need to know before running the mwm tests
---------------------------------------------------------

Please consult the README at ./tests/mwm for more information on running these
tests.

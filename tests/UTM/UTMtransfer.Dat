#) This is the UTMtransfer test.
#) You must see a UTMtransfer window on your screen and a UTMPrim1 window.
#) If you don't see an UTMPrim1 window, please run:
!)
              "UTMPrim1 -u -n&"

C)

#) The following panels test the transfer of the primary selection.
#) When you select an object with a primary selection, and then transfer it 
   (copying it) in an other widget, the following actions should occur:
!)
          1. The convertCallback of the widget owning the primary 
             selection is called multiple times with the selection 
             field set to PRIMARY and different conversion target 
             that this widget supports as a source of data.

          2. The destinationCallback of the widget receiving 
             the transfer is called with the selection field 
             set to PRIMARY and the operation field set to XmCOPY.

#) In our test, the destination widget is the drawing area (red square) in the 
   UTMtransfer window.
C)

#) Select the "Amazing" word in the TextField widget of the UTMPrim1 window.
#) Pulldown the "Edit" menu of the UTMtransfer window and select 
   "Paste (copy)".
#) The list of targets supported by the TextField widget appears in the list
   of the UTMtransfer window.

		README for tests/environment
		============================


    This directory hierarchy is a reflection of the environment under
    which all the automated testing was conducted internally at OSF.
    The list of directories under 'bin' represents the list of platforms
    on which the testing was done. You can add your platform following
    the same model. Make sure you modify your path so that the platform-
    specific binaries you build will be found and used.

    Before making this your environment, there are a couple of things
    you should do.

        1. Build the fonts provided under 'fonts/bdf' directory using
           a resident font compiler and place the executables under
           the appropriate sub-directory (corresponding to your platform)
           under the 'fonts' directory. Since this is the list of
           fonts being used by various tests at run time, you will need
           to build the fonts to get the right results from your
           automated runs. Make sure this fonts directory is added to
	   your font path, either via 'xset' or as a command line argument
	   when you run your server. (See the startx_* files for examples
	   of the latter.)

        2. You need to run the Motif window manager built from the Motif 2.0 
	   sources. 

	Once you have completed the steps mentioned above, you need to
	make sure that your environment gets set up correctly, before
	starting the test runs. Here is what we did to ensure this.

	We created an account 'qauser'. We created this whole environment
	hierarchy under the home directory of 'qauser' (~qauser/.). 
	We began each test run by logging in as qauser in the following way:

		Logout from the current session to console

		Login as 'qauser'

		% startx || startx_color || startx_mono


	This will ensure that the environment is set up correctly for the
	specified platform with the correct version of mwm running.

	If you wish to run the tests from your home directory, copy all
	the qauser files into your home directory, preserving your own
	defaults elsewhere. Note that the .motifbind files are in the 
	platform-specific subdirectories. You will probably need a fair number
	of modifications to your home environment to get the tests to
	work properly. We suggest use of the 'qauser' account if at all
	possible.


	Other tools:

	In the ./bin directory you will find a script call scrline. This
	script can help you isolate the exact source line of a .scr file
	that is causing an error. The line number printed out by the
	automation code refers to the UNCOMMENTED line number, so scrline
	is useful in debugging scripts with comments.

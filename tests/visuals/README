		README for tests/visuals
		========================


This directory contains the visual files (*.vis) and output files (*.prt)
for the directories which have been automated for the Motif 2.0 release. 
Each file in these directories corresponds to a test in the Motif 2.0 test
suite. The visual files (*.vis) contain normalized screen "pictures" of the
test which was recorded. The output files (*.prt) contain 
the redirection of STDOUT and STDERR. Output files generally contain
callback information and warning messages issued from Xm, Xt, Automation
or the test code itself. The directories contained in this area correspond 
to the entries in the file $MOTIF_TOP/tests/General/dirsAuto.

		Using this information
		======================

The information in these directories is used to verify the results of
regression tests. Two types of comparisons are made: first, the visuals
of the test being executed are compared against the previously-recorded
images stored in the .vis file. Second, all statements printed out to
STDOUT and STDERR are compared with the previously stored output (.prt) 
file. (The output of the .vis and .prt files shipped in this directory 
were recorded against Motif 2.0.) By using both types of comparisons, we
assure that both the appearance and behavior of Motif remain the same
across releases.

Some of the files in these directories are incorrect, i.e. they have some
know problem. For the list of known problems with these files please 
refer to the OPENBUGS file at the top of the Motif 2.0 source tree.

		AUTOVPATH environment variable
		==============================

The environment variable AUTOVPATH allows the tester to choose the location
of the output files. If you will be using the RUN scripts, modify the
AUTOVPATH variable in the RUN.custom file to reference the location of
the output files for that test directory. If you are running individual tests,
set the environment variable in the shell.

For example, if the tester is running List1 from /Motif2.0/tests/Toolkit/List
then he/she would set AUTOVPATH to the directory which contains the visuals
and output from List1, for example /Motif2.0/tests/visuals/Toolkit/List.
This way List1.vis from /Motif2.0/tests/visuals/Toolkit/List will be used
for visual comparisons, and List1.prt from /Motif2.0/tests/visuals/Toolkit/List
will be used for comparison of STDERR/STDOUT information. ONLY when both these
files compare correctly is the test considered passed.

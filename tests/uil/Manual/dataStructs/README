DESCRIPTION:

This directory contains tests of UIL data structures.  These tests are
noninteractive, and each test prints result messages to stdout.  The
script run_all will run all of the tests and redirect the output to the
file dataStruct.out.



TESTS:

CompoundS - Tests the UIL compound_string function

Font      - Tests the UIL font function

Pixmap    - Tests the UIL icon function

Tables    - Tests the various UIL data structure table functions
	    (integer table, compound_string table, asciz_string table,
	    font table) as well as the identifier data structure type

Simple    - Tests the simple UIL data structure types (boolean, color,
	    float, integer, string)



FILES:

CompoundS.c    - source file for CompoundS test
CompoundS.h    - declarations for CompoundS test

Font.c         - source file for Font test
Font.h         - declarations for Font test

Imakefile      - file for generating Makefile

Pixmap.c       - source file for Pixmap test
Pixmap.h       - declarations for Pixmap test

README         - this file

Simple.c       - source file for Simple test
Simple.h       - declarations for Simple test

Tables.c       - source file for Tables test
Tables.h       - declarations for Tables test

dataS.uil      - value and object declarations for all tests

font_compare.c - convenience routine to compare two font structures

icon2.xbm      - bitmap file to be read into uid file

run_all        - script which runs all of these tests and redirects
		   the output to the file dataStruct.out



COMPILATION:

To compile all of these tests type either "make" or "make all".

To compile individual tests:

CompoundS - "make CompoundS dataS.uid"

Font      - "make Font dataS.uid"

Pixmap    - "make Pixmap dataS.uid"

Tables    - "make Tables dataS.uid"

Simple    - "make Simple dataS.uid"



EXECUTION:

To run any of these tests, simply type the name of the test, e.g.

% Font

To run all of these tests at the same time, type

% run_all

This script will run all of the tests and redirect the output to the file
dataStruct.out.

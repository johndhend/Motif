DESCRIPTION:

This directory contains the test of UIL multiple callbacks.  This test is
noninteractive, and prints result messages to stdout.  The script run_multC
will run the test and redirect the output to the file multC.out.



TEST:

multC - Tests UIL multiple callbacks



FILES:

Imakefile   - file for generating Makefile

README      - this file

multC.c     - source file for multC test
multC.h     - declarations for multC test
multC.uil   - value and object declarations for multC test



COMPILATION:

To compile this test, type either "make" or "make all".

NOTE: One part of this test involves specifying a reason more than once in the
      same callback list.  This is a valid operation, but will cause seven (7)
      informational messages to be produces while compiling the file multC.uil.
      These messages are expected, and the file multC.uid will still be
      generated.



EXECUTION:

To run this test, simply type

% multC

To run this test and redirect output to the file multC.out, type

% run_multC

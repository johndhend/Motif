# HISTORY

# 
#	This shell script will run the UIL National Language Extension tests.
#	It repeatedly runs the file NL with various resource settings which
#	alter the search paths and file names passed to Mrm.  The test 
#	succeeds by opening the correct file(s) and fetching string(s) 
#	from the opened files such that the strings match those provided
#	on the command line as the "valid1" or "valid2" resources.

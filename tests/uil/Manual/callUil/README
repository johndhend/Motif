CALLABLE UIL TEST:

This test will test the Callable Uil compiler portion of UIL. It is designed
to be user interactive, with on-line user instructions for each part of the 
test. This test consists of 5 files, 3 Uil files testing various compilation
states(success, error, and warning), the main C file to do the compilations
and create an example list utility, and an associated header file. The test
will first compile the UIL file with the error and display to the user all
relevant information. It will then compile the UIL file with the warning,
again giving the user useful information. Finally the correct UIL file will 
be compiled and its associated UID file used in an example list utility.


DESCRIPTION OF FILES:

CallUil.c	-	The C routines to compile the various UIL files
			and to display the list utility.
CallUil.h	-	Header file defining variables and message information
			for the tests.
run		-	script to run test.
xlist.uil	-	correct UIL file to define interface for list utility
xlistError.uil	-	UIL file with error on last line to test Callable UIL
			error features.
xlistWarn.uil	-	UIL file with a warning to test Callable UIL warning
			features.


NOTE:

To have tests appear in the Top Left corner of the root window the resource

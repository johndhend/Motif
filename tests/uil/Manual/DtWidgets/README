The UIL/Mrm Convergence tests in this directory test the new Dt resources
of following wdigets:

	DtEditor
	DtHelpDialog
	DtHelpQuickDialog
	DtPrintSetupBox
	DtPrintSetupDialog
	DtTerm
	DtMenuButton


QATS AUTOMATION:
-----------------

QATS does not support complete automation of tests invloving Dt widgets.
QATS automation does not recognize the widget names/ids of the above widgets
and their children. This limits the use of automation of QATS, for example, 
in moving the pointer to a specific child of a Dt widget and clicking MB and 
test a particular resource.

Moreover, none of the children of the above widgets are created from the
application. The DtWdiget comes up with various child widgets, like 
Text, MenuBar, PushButton, etc., at the time of creation and some resources
are used to set the values in these child widgets.

For this reason, these tests should be built and run manaually for a complete
test of all the resources.


Building and Running tests:
---------------------------

When creating Makefile in this directory, do not use IMAKE_DEFINES=-DAUTOMATION
which builds the tests for automation.

Use run_dtwidget <testname> to run the tests induvidually.
example: run_dtwidget term 
		to run the test which tests DtTerm widget and verify whatever
		is claimed in the Instruction Panel. You might want to
		go into some menus or click on some buttons.



DtMenuButton test:
------------------

This test currently does not test the resource DtNsubMenuId.

UIL TEST SUITE:

    This is a test suite that displays all MOTIF widgets created with UIL.
It it designed to be user interactive, with on-line user instructions
accompanying each test widget. All widgets have two files associated with them.
The first is the uil file itself and the second is a message file which 
contains the description of the widget to be displayed. Also included is a 
common C source file that will display the UID file produced from the UIL test 
code. This C file is very generic and is intended only to display single 
hierarchy UID files.

DESCRIPTION OF FILES:

displayUid.c 	- 	The generic C routine to display UID files, report
			Callbacks, and popup a popupMenu. 
reasons.h	-	The header file which contains an array of REASONS for
			reporting Callbacks.
Imakefile	-	The Imakefile is used to build Makefile. When Makefile
			is built, it can be used to build displayUid and all 
			UID files from their associated UIL files. Syntax is
			make <rootname of UIL file> - to build UID file, or
			make all - to build everthing, or
			make displayUid - to build displayUid, or
			make clean  - to remove all UID files 
README_UILTS	-	The file you are reading, containing information about
			the UIL test suite.
run_all		-	A simple shell script that will execute all tests
			sequentially.
*.uil		-	The UIL sources for this test suite.
*.msg		-	The message files that correspond to the UIL test 
			you are building, containing a description of the 
			test being displayed.

REPORTING CALLBACKS:

Callbacks are simply handled by printing to STDOUT the name of the callback
that has been triggered, and the REASON for that callback. To find out how to 
trigger a callback, refer to the appropriate page in the "OSF Motif Programmers
Reference Manual" . A callback is active when it is defined as ON in the 
message portion of the test.

NOTE:

To have tests appear in the Top Left corner of the root window the resource
Mwm*clientAutoPlace should be set to false in you .Xdefaults file.

#) The following is a Bulletin Board set up to test correct handling of gadget
   specification syntax. 

#) The bulletin board contains two of each supported gadget. 

#) The module header for this test specifies the gadget variant for each 
   object supporting a gadget variant. Thus the gadget in the left 
   column was specified with Xm<type> syntax. The gadget in 
   the right column was specified with Xm<type>Gadget syntax. 

#) The CascadeButton gadgets are contained in a MenuBar. 
   A Message stating that the callback reason for 
   MrmNcreateCallback is 43 should be printed in the 
   term window.

#) Enumerated Values Test 4:
!)	 The following is a Bulletin Board set up to test correct
	 usage of enumeration values. (Note: this explanation text
	 itself tests the following:
	 - XmNeditMode = XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT
#) Bulletin Board characteristics:
!)	 - XmNborderWidth = 1
	 - XmNbackground =  sky_blue
	 - XmNmarginWidth =  20
	 - XmNmarginHeight =  20
	 - XmNdefaultPosition =  false
	 - XmNnoResize =  true
	 - XmNResizePolicy = XmRESIZE_GROW
	 - XmNshadowType = XmSHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
	 - XmNshadowThickness = 10
#) ArrowButton characteristics:
!)	 - XmNx = 30
	 - XmNy = 30
	 - XmNarrowDirection = XmARROW_LEFT
	 - XmNwidth = 40
	 - XmNheight = 40
	 - XmNshadowThickness = 5
#) ScrollBar characteristics:
!)	 - XmNx = 30
	 - XmNy = 90
	 - XmNwidth = 300
	 - XmNheight = 20
	 - XmNminimum = 0
	 - XmNmaximum = 100

#) Enumerated Values Test 6:
!)	 The following is a Bulletin Board set up to test correct
	 usage of enumeration values. (Note: this explanation text
	 itself tests the following:
	 - XmNeditMode = XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT
#) Bulletin Board characteristics:
!)	 - XmNborderWidth = 1
	 - XmNbackground =  sky_blue
	 - XmNmarginWidth =  20
	 - XmNmarginHeight =  20
	 - XmNdefaultPosition =  false
	 - XmNnoResize =  true
	 - XmNResizePolicy = XmRESIZE_GROW
	 - XmNshadowType = XmSHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
	 - XmNshadowThickness = 10
#) Form charactereristics:
!)	 - XmNx = 30
	 - XmNy = 30
	 - XmNwidth = 300
	 - XmNheight = 150
	 - XmNborderWidth = 2
	 - XmNresizePolicy = XmRESIZE_GROW
#) Form children:
!)    Toggle 1:
    	 - XmNleftAttachment = XmATTACH_FORM
    	 - XmNleftOffset = 10
    	 - XmNtopAttachment = XmATTACH_POSITION
    	 - XmNtopPosition = 10
    	 - XmNlabelString = Toggle 1 (with a longer name)
    	 - XmNshadowThickness = 2
    	 - XmNborderWidth = 1
      Toggle 2:
    	 - XmNbottomAttachment = XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_FORM
    	 - XmNbottomOffset = -90
    	 - XmNrightAttachment = XmATTACH_OPPOSITE_WIDGET
    	 - XmNrightWidget = XmToggleButton ToggleButtonF1
    	 - XmNindicatorType = XmN_OF_MANY
    	 - XmNlabelString = Toggle 2 (shorter name)
    	 - XmNshadowThickness = 2
    	 - XmNborderWidth = 1
      Toggle 3:
    	 - XmNtopAttachment = XmATTACH_WIDGET
    	 - XmNtopWidget = XmToggleButton ToggleButtonF2
    	 - XmNtopOffset = 10
    	 - XmNleftAttachment = XmATTACH_WIDGET
    	 - XmNleftWidget = XmToggleButton ToggleButtonF2
    	 - XmNbottomAttachment = XmATTACH_FORM
    	 - XmNbottomOffset = 10
    	 - XmNindicatorType = XmONE_OF_MANY

Three tests in this directory, FileSelect1, FileSelect2 and FileSelect3,
require manual setup.  There is a subdirectory, FS, of this directory
that must be the target directory of the FSB in order for automated
image comparison to succeed.  Those three tests expect to access the FS
directory via /tmp.  A link to the FS directory must be place in /tmp
before the tests can be run, viz.:

ln -s $TOP/tests/Toolkit/Select/FS /tmp

where $TOP is the directory under which the Motif source is installed.

If the link has not been properly created, each of the tests will exit
with the message:

Target directory /tmp/FS/fourteencharac/fourteencharac/fourteencharac/
	is not set up

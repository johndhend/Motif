#) A client window will appear containing a command widget. 
#) Move the pointer into the client window. 
#) Press the return key.  Three X Toolkit warnings will be
   printed into the xterm window.  These warnings refer to
   command widget resources which were set incorrectly. 
#) Type a command into the command area and press the return
   key.  An X Toolkit warning will be printed into the xterm
   window.  This warning is caused by an attempt to fetch a
   nonexistent child of the command widget. 
C)

#) Move the pointer into the client window. 
#) Type a command into the command area and press the return key.
   Two X Toolkit warnings will be printed into the xterm window.
   These warnings are caused by attempts to replace the command
   string with bad strings. 
#) Type a command into the command area and press the return key.
   The history list will move up two lines, but no error message
   will be displayed below the history list.  This behavior is
   caused by attempts to display bad error strings.
   During one of the last two actions, scroll bars
   will have appeared around the list. 
#) Type a character into the command area.  An X Toolkit warning
   will be printed into the xterm window.  This warning is caused
   by an attempt to append a bad string to the command string.

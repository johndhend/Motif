#) A client containing 3 PushButtons in a Form should have appeared on your
   screen. The PushButtons should be labeled "Draw Rectangle", 
   "Erase Rectangle", and "Change Highlight".
#) Click on "Draw Rectangle". A rectangle will be drawn on the left side of
   the Form. The lines should be about 5 pixels thick.
#) Click on "Erase Rectangle". The rectangle will disappear.
#) Click on "Change Highlight". Note the highlight thickness of this
   PushButton.
#) Click on "Draw Rectangle" again. A rectangle should be drawn again. The
   highlight thickness should continue to be about 5 pixels. If instead, it
   is equal to the highlight thickness of the "Change Highlight" PushButton,
   CR 2761 hasn't been fixed.

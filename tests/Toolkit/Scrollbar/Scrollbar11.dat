@) A client with two vertical scrollbars will appear. Both will have
   a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 90. The one on the left
   will have the maximum on the top, the one on the right will have the
   maximum on the bottom.

#) Verify the maximum and minimum are in the correct place for each
   scrollbar. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to change the value of the
   Scrollbar. (The value will be displayed in the stdout window.)

#) Press MB1 on the thumb of the left hand Scrollbar. Drag the thumb as
   far to the top as it will go. Release MB1. A VALUE_CHANGED callback
   will be displayed in the stdout window, the value should be equal to 90 (the
   maximum)

#) Change the scrollbar value with the keyboard and verify the following
   behavior (check ~/.motifbind for key bindings). Look at the behavior
   of the scrollbar, and the output in the stdout window:

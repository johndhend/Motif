@) A client with a vertical scale widget will appear.  
   The scale will
   have a title labeled "Affected", and will have the
   slider value shown to the left of the slider.  The font will be
   variable and the shadowThickness will be 8 pixels initially. 
/* test case for PIR 3158 */
#) Click on the "horizontal" orientation togglebutton.  This will alter 
the orientation of the "Affected" scale.
#) Using MB1, drag the "scaleWidth" slider out to about 60.  The
"Affected" scale should be just wider than its title string ("Affected").
#) Using the osfLeft arrow key, lower the "scaleWidth" value
repeatly until the width of the "Affected" scale is less than
the width of its title string.
#) Using MB1, drag the "scaleWidth" slider out to about 80.  The "Affected"
scale should grow in width.  Drag the "scaleWidth" slider in to about 35.  The 
"Affected" scale should shrink in width.
#) Using the osfRight arrow key, raise the "scaleWidth" value a few 
numbers and verify that the "Affected" scale is growing accordingly.
/* end of test case for PIR 3158 */
C)
/* test case for PIR 3157 */
#) Click on the "vertical" orientation togglebutton.  This will alter 
the orientation of the "Affected" scale.
#) Using MB1, drag the "scaleWidth" slider out to about 50.
The scale labeled "Affected" should grow in width.
#) Using MB1, drag the "scaleHeight" slider out to about 30.
The "Affected" scale should shrink in height.
#) With the highlight still on the "scaleHeight" scale, press the
osfLeft arrow key enough times to bring the height value down to 21.
As the scale is adjusted, the "Affected" scale should be shrinking in height.
#) Press the osfLeft key one more time and observe that the
"Affected" scale is shrinking normally.  
@) WARNING: The next step may crash the server if the defect has not
been resolved yet.
#) Press the osfLeft key a few more times and continue to observe the
behavior of the "Affected" scale.
/* end of test case for PIR 3157 */
C)
/* test case for PIR 3154 */
#) Click on the "set defaults" pushbutton.  The "Affected" scale should
return to its initial shape and size, and all the control widgets below
it should be reset to their initial readings.

# HISTORY
#  @) A client with a vertical scale widget will appear.  
#     The scale will
#     have a title labeled "Affected", and will have the
#     slider value shown to the left of the slider.  The font will be
#     variable and the shadowThickness will be 8 pixels initially.

#  /* test case for PIR 3158 */
#  #) Click on the "horizontal" orientation togglebutton.  This will alter 
#  the orientation of the "Affected" scale.

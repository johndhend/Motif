@) A client with a vertical scale widget will appear.  There will be
   11 label widgets (\"0\", \"10\", \"20\", \"30\", \"40\",
   \"50\", \"60\", \"70\",
   \"80\", \"90\", and \"100\") to left of the scale.  The labels will
   all have small borders.  The labels will be created AFTER the TOP
   level shell has been realized.  This process will be very slow. 
#) Press and hold down MB1 on the slider and drag it up and down.
   Verify that the value to the left of the slider corresponds to
   the slider's position within the scale. 
   A message "Test dragCallback called" will be printed to the stdout 
   window.  Release MB1. The value and reason of the valueChanged 
   callback is printed to the stdout window.
#) Press MB1 in the scroll region above the slider.  Verify that the
   value to the left of the slider corresponds to the slider's
   position within the scale.  The value and reason of the valueChanged
   callback will be printed to the stdout window. 
#) Resize the client larger.  The labels should spread out and
   remain on the left side of the client window, the scroll region
   should span the right side of the client window, and the value
   should be to the left of the slider. 
#) Resize the client smaller until the labels overlap. 
C)
@) The scale widget will now be horizontal, with the label widgets
   arrayed above it. 
#) Press and hold down MB1 on the slider and drag it to the right
   and to the left.  Verify that the value above the slider
   corresponds to the slider's position within the scale. 
   A message "Test dragCallback called" will be printed to the stdout 
   window.  Release MB1. The value and reason of the valueChanged 
   callback is printed to the stdout window.
#) Press MB1 in the scroll region to the left of the slider.  Verify
   that the value above the slider corresponds to the slider's
   position within the scale.  The value and reason of the 
   valueChanged callback will be printed to the stdout window. 
#) Resize the client larger.  The labels should spread out and
   remain at the top of the client window, the scroll region should
   span the botttom of the client window, and the value should be
   above the slider. 
#) Resize the client smaller until the labels overlap.

This directory is used for the 'smoke testing' in
the Motif Nightly Build process.

During the smoke testing the directory gets populated
with the links to the several tests in the tests/Tookit
directory. The 'smoke_test' script from the internal/bin/share
directory control the building and automated execution of 
the tests, according to the instructions in the logs/smoke.rc file.

The results of the smoke testing are included in the
Nightly Build Summary.

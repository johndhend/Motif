	This test confirms the functionality of the Xme transfer functions.
These functions utilize the Xt selection mechanism to choose the data
that is to be transferred.  The types of transfers that are tested
include:  Drag and Drop; Primary selection; Secondary selection; and 
Clipboard.

#) The test cases are run using two modified ExmStringTransfer widgets.
For each test case one widget will be the "source" and the other will
be the "destination".  These terms will be used in the test case instructions
and can be loosely interpreted as "initiator" and "receiver".

#) Each case will instruct you on how to set up the test using the 
control panel window.  This window includes pulldown menus for each
of the test case types.

#) Also a "Reset" button is present which will reinitialize the strings
in the widgets if you'd like to start the test again. Always reset the
widgets before starting a new test case.

C)	This test validates the operation of the Xme Drag and Drop
convenience functions.  Drag and Drop is supported by using Button2
to drag the data from the "source" widget to the "destination" widget.

#)	Place the cursor over one of the widgets and hold button2 down.
	The cursor should change and the widget should be highlighted.
#)	Drag the mouse over the destination widget (this widget should
	now be highlighted).
#)	Then release the mouse button and the icon should "dissolve" into
	the destination widget and the data from the source widget will appear.
#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)	This test validates the operation of the Xme Primary selection
convenience functions.  Primary selection is a mechanism that uses a two
step transfer process.  First data is selected in the "source" widget
(Press Button1, drag mouse, then release Button1), then press Button2 
over the "destination" widget.  (NOTE: the highlighting code has not been
added yet.)

#)	Choose the "Primary" option in the Test Case pulldown menu located
in the control window.  Then Press the "Reset" button.
#)	First, we'll perform a COPY test.  Place the cursor over one of
the widgets and hold Button1 down, drag the mouse, then release.  The
xterm will print messages to confirm this action. Place the mouse over
the destination widget press Button2 and the data from the source widget
should appear.
#)	Press the "Reset" button in the control panel.
#)	Now we'll perform a MOVE test. Select the data as in the previous
case.  Move the mouse to the destination widget and hold down the "Shift" key
and at the same time press Button2.
The data from the source widget will appear in the destination widget and
the source widget will become blank.
#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)	This test validates the operation of the Xme Secondary selection
convenience functions.  Secondary selection is a mechanism that uses a two
step transfer process.  First a data destination is selected (using Button2)
then data is selected in the "source" widget (Press Button1, drag mouse).
Then when Button3 is pressed the transfer occurs.  It is important to note
that at Button2 must be pressed on the source widget (where the data selection
occurs). (NOTE: the underlining code has not been added yet.)

#)	Choose the "Secondary" option in the Test Case pulldown menu located
in the control window.  Then Press the "Reset" button.
#)	First, we'll perform a COPY test.  Place the cursor over one of
the widgets which is to be the destination and press Button2.  Then select
the data by pressing Button1 over the other widget.  Finally, press
Button3 over the same widget where the "selection" occurred.  Data in 
the destination widget will be updated by the data from the source widget.
#)	Press the "Reset" button in the control panel.
#)	Now we'll perform a MOVE test. Select the destination widget 
(Button2) and source data as in the previous case (Button1).  Then press
Button3 while holding down the "Shift" key.  The data from the source wdiget
will appear in the destination widget and the source widget will become blank.
#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)	This test validates the operation of the Xme Clipboard convenience
functions.  This transfer method is perhaps the simplest.  By using Button1
we COPY data to the Clipboard and Button2 retrieves the data.  The "Shift"
modifier performs a MOVE operation when we select the data.

#)	Choose the "Clipboard" option in the Test Case pulldown menu located
in the control window.
#)	Press the "Reset" button.
#)	First, we'll perform a COPY test.  Place the cursor over one of
the widgets which is to be the source widget and press Button1. Then
press Button2 over the other widget.  Data that was sent to the clipboard
will appear on the destination widget.  NOTE: this will take longer to appear
than previous tests.
#)	Press the "Reset" button in the control panel.
#)	Now we'll perform a MOVE test. Select the source data and use the
"Shift" key as a modifier (Hold the "Shift" key and click Button1).  NOTE: the
source widget will become blank.  Then press Button2 over the other widget.
Data will appear in the destination widget.
#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)
	 Press Exit to end the test.  
         Goodbye.

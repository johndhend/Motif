	This test checks the XmeResolvePartOffsets function.  The
ExmTabButton widget has been modified to use offsets.  For each test case
the resource "OpenSide" has been modified.  The validation exists of
instantiating the widget and checking the visual effect of the resource
on the widget.

#) The "OpenSide" resource effects the specified side of the button by
omitting the shadow for that side.  The visual check to be performed is
simply making sure that no shadow is present for the specified side.  
(Note that by clicking on the button the shadow colors will alternate to
make this check more obvious.)

#) This first test validates the default value of the resource.  The
default value is XmLEFT.  Check that the left side of the button has no
shadow.

#) Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.


C)  This test validates the setting of the resource to the 
value of XmTOP.  Check that the top side of the button has no
shadow.

#) Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)  This test validates the setting of the resource to the 
value of XmRIGHT.  Check that the right side of the button has no
shadow.

#) Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

 * HISTORY
 */

	This test starts is a timing test.  The application will "sleep"
	(become inactive for several seconds).

#) 	To begin press "Validate" and make sure that the xterm prints
	the message "Button Press received".

#)	Press "Start Sleep" and then press "Validate" again.  Note that
	until the Sleep test is complete the message "Button Press
	received" does not appear.

#)	Finally, make sure that the Sleep test has passed.  (No error
	messages are printed out to the xterm)

C)
	The next test begins by resetting the cursor for the window
	to the "NULL" cursor.

#)	Move the mouse inside and outside of the window.  While the
	cursor is inside the window you should not be able
	to see the it.  While outside the window the default cursor
	returns.  (NOTE: "inside the window" does NOT include the window's
	border and decorations)

#)	Press Mouse button number 1 while inside the window (on either
	button).  Make sure 
	that even while the cursor is "NULL" the button still appears
	to be pressed and the xterm should print the message "Button Press
	received".
C)
	 Press Exit to end the test.  
         Goodbye.

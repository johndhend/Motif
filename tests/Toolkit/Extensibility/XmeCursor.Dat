	to the "NULL" cursor.

#)	Move the mouse inside and outside of the window.  While the
	cursor is inside the window you should not be able
	to see the it.  While outside the window the default cursor
	returns.  (NOTE: "inside the window" does NOT include the window's
	border and decorations)

#)	Press Mouse button number 1 while inside the window (on either
	button).  Make sure 
	that even while the cursor is "NULL" the button still appears
	to be pressed and the xterm should print the message "Button Press
	received".

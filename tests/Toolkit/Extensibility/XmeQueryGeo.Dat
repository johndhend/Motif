This test for XmeReplyToQueryGeometry is based on passing geometry requests
to the ExmGrid demo widget which in turn calls the function.  Different
geometry requests are sent to illicit all of the possible responses: 
XtGeometryNo, XtGeometryYes, and XtGeometryAlmost.  Each test case will
involve making an XtGeometryRequest and checking the result.  There is NO
visual change to inspect for validating a test case.  Just make sure that
no error messages occur.

C)  This test case checks for XtGeometryNo.  The widget's intended size
is identical to the actual size of the widget.

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)  This test case checks for XtGeometryYes.

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)  This test case checks for XtGeometryAlmost.

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

/*
 * HISTORY
 */

	This test confirms several aspects of XmStrings as they are used 
	in the Extensibility functions.
#)
	The first case checks that a localized string is created and 
	displayed.  The string displayed on the window should read
	"Test String".  Make sure that no error messages are printed in 
	the xterm window.
C)
	This test confirms the proper displaying of a reverse direction
	string.  The word "Reverse" is used and thus should appear as
	"esreveR".
C)
	This test validates the encoding value of the current locale.
	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.
C)
	This test checks the XmeGetNextCharacter function.  This 
	function is used while parsing a string. This instance
	works on the string "Shoot Out, okay" the function uses a key
	character (in this case the letter 'o') and returns the 
	following character.  So the string displayed should read
	"Shot Out, kay".
C)
	This test validates the operation of the XmeGetDirection function
	used during parsing a string.  The test will check the value of
	the retuned XmString component, which should be a directional
	XmString component.

#)	Because a direction change has no text the widget should display
	any characters. 

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)
	 Press Exit to end the test.  
         Goodbye.

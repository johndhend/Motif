	This test verifies Xme functions that deal with data transfer and
specifically the "target" data handling.  Targets are data items that are
used for widgets to understand what kind of data is being presented during
a transfer.  The functions that are tested include: XmeStandardTargets,
XmeStandardConvert, XmeConvertMerge and XmeTransferAddDoneProc.	 These tests
will be validated in conjunction with a transfer operation and while the
widgets will be updated, you will only be looking for ERROR messages to
confirm pass or fail.

C)	The first test will require a primary data transfer.  This is
accomplished by first selecting the data then indicating a destination 
widget.

#)  Place the cursor over "Widget ONE" and click mouse Button1.  Place
the mouse over "Widget TWO" and press Button2.  The data from the source
widget should appear.

#)  Now press the "Reset" button, to initialize the text data in the widgets.

#)  Make sure that there are no error messages printed in the xterm.

C)	The next test will also require a primary data transfer.  This is
accomplished by first selecting the data, then indicating a destination 
widget.

#)  Place the cursor over "Widget ONE" and click mouse Button1.  Place
the mouse over "Widget TWO" and press Button2.  The data in the widget
will NOT be updated.

#)  Make sure that there are no error messages printed in the xterm.

C)
	 Press Exit to end the test.  
         Goodbye.

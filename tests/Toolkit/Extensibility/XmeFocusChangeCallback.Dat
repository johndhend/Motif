	This test checks the focus callback management routines for
	a widget.  A callback can be added and removed from the
	list of focus change callback procedures.

#) 	To begin press "Validate" and make sure that no messages 
	appear in the xterm window.

C)
	The next test begins by adding a new focus change callback
	for the button's shell widget.  The callback message "New Focus
	Change Callback has been called" is printed in the xterm
	window everytime the focus enters or leaves the shell.  NOTE:
	the message should be printed twice as this test case starts.

#)	Move the mouse over the button itself and press the first
	mouse button.  The callback message should print.  Press the
	mouse button once again and make sure the message does not 
	print.
C)
	The next test removes the change focus callback so that
	no message is printed when this occurs.

#)	Move the mouse to the title bar of the button.  Press the
	first mouse button and make sure that NO callback message
	is printed.  Repeat this test by pressing the button itself.
C)
	 Press Exit to end the test.  
         Goodbye.

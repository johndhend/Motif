# HISTORY

# #) This is the Container1 Test run with option "-I Container1b.Dat -u b".
# C)
# #) The container widget should be displayed in its LARGE_ICON view, 
#    an OUTLINE layoutType.
# #) Four IconGadgets with the pixmap part displaying a "L" within
#    a black box, and the label part displaying the strings "IconGad1",
#    "IconGad2", "IconGad3" and "IconGad4" respectively should be visible
#    in a single column.
# #) There should also be visible to the left of IconGad3, a
#    pixmap displaying letter "C" with background white and foreground
#    black. This indicates that the item "IconGad3" has child items that
#    are not displayed; in other words, this item is in the collapsedState.

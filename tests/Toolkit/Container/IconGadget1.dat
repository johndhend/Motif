#) A drawing area will appear containing 3 icon gadgets.
#) "IconGad1" is displayed in its LARGE_ICON view, using the mountain bitmap.
   The label string "IconGad1" should be beneath the icon. 
   It has 3 details displayed next to it, saying "First object Chocolate 33".
#) "IconGad2" and "IconGad3" are also displayed in their large icon view, 
   but are not using any pixmap.
#) The respective position of the 3 icon gadgets should be (20,20), (50,100)
   and (30,170).
#) A control panel should appear composed of 10 rows of resources,
   then an "Apply" button and a check box for selecting the icon gadgets

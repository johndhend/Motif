#) The container widget should be displayed in its ANY_ICON view, 
   with a DETAIL layoutType.
#) There should be 4 columns displayed.
#) There should be a Headings row with the various Column Headings and
   there should be 4 rows of IconGadgets.
#) Each row should display pixmap-label combination of an IconGadget
   in the first right-most column.
   "IconGad1", "IconGad2" and "IconGad4" should be displayed in their
   small icon view. "IconGad3" should be displayed in its large icon view.
   The labels should be aligned to the right edge of the pixmaps.
#) The remaining three columns in each row should display plain text.
#) The first row is selected with an aquamarine color.
#) Move the pointer into the "Container1" window. The first row should have
   the focus, highlighted with a red border around it.

   in a single column.  The labels should be aligned to the right
   of the pixmap.
#) There should also be visible to the right of IconGad3, a
   pixmap displaying letter "C" with background white and foreground
   black. This indicates that the item "IconGad3" has child items that
   are not displayed; in other words, this item is in the collapsedState.
#) Click BSelect on the collapsedState pixmap "C" displayed to the right
   of the item "IconGad3".

   and "IconGad33", displayed to the left of IconGad3, with each of 
   these items connected to the item "IconGad3" with solid single

#) The container should resize itself to fit in the new items.
#) You should also see a message in the term window indicating that
   a outlineChangedCallback has been invoked with the reason 
   XmCR_EXPANDED.
#) The item "IconGad32" should also have, to its right, a pixmap
   displaying letter "C" with background white and foreground black,

 * HISTORY
 */

#) This is Container5 running with the option "-u c"
#) A Container will appear empty.
#) It has been created with an spatialStyle set to NONE.

C)

#) 9 Icon Gadgets are added to the Container. They should be placed in the 
   Container relatively to their X and Y values.
!)	     IconGad0	 10  10
	     IconGad1	 90  10
	     Icongad2	200  20
	     Icongad3	300  50
	     IconGad4	 10  90
	     IconGad5   170 100
	     IconGad6   100 170
	     IconGad7	170 180
	     IconGad8	250 180
C)

#) The spatialStyle is changed to XmGRID, with an IncludeModel set to CLOSEST,
   and a SnapModel set to SNAP_TO_GRID.
#) The Icon gadgets should slighlty move to have their top left corner
   attached to the top left corner of the cell they occupied.
#) So the grid you have is as follow:
!)	       IconGad0    IconGad1    IconGad2    IconGad3
	       IconGad4                IconGad5
	                   IconGad6    IconGad7    IconGad8
C)

#) A new Icon Gadget is added to the Container. 
#) It should be placed under IconGad4 to the left of IconGad6.
C)

#) The spatialIncludeModel is now set to FIRST_FIT.
#) A new Icon Gadget is added to the Container. It should be included 
   in the first empty cell in the Container, that is it should be placed
   under IconGad1 to the right of IconGad4.

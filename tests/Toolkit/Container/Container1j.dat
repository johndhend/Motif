#) This is the Container1 Test run with option "-I Container1j.Dat -u j".
C)

#) The container widget should be displayed in its SMALL_ICON view,
   with a DETAIL layoutType.
#) There should be 3 columns and there should be 4 rows of 
   IconGadgets.
#) Each row should display pixmap-label combination of an IconGadget
   in the first column, with the pixmap displaying the letter "S" on
   a black background and the label text should display "IconGad1",
   "IconGad2", "IconGad3" and "IconGad4" respectively.
#) The remaining two columns in each row should display plain text.
#) The first row is selected with an aquamarine color.
#) Move the pointer into the "Container1" window. The first row should have
   the focus, highlighted with a red border around it.

#) The selectionPolicy is BROWSE_SELECT.
#) Press BSelect on row 1 and drag to row 3.
#) As you drag the pointer over each item, you should see a message
   of the following type in the term window:

      Reason for SelectionCallback: CR_BROWSE_SELECT
      Number of items selected: 1
      Names of items selected: <name>

	  where <name> corresponds to "IconGad1", "IconGad2", etc.

 * HISTORY
 */

#) A client with six messageBoxes will appear. Each
   messageBox has a message, a separator, and three pushButtons.
   The Help pushButton should appear on the left and the Ok pushButton
   on the right. Last five messageBoxes have a symbol to the right 
   of the message. The message "Focus has arrived in MessageBox" 
   appears in the xterm window.
   
C)
#) Move client window so that it slightly obscures the
   term window. Iconify the client window. Normalize the
   term window. 
   At least two more "Focus has arrived in MessageBox" 
   messages appear in the xterm window. (You many get more depending
   on how many times you give focus to the MessageBox1 client window.)
#) Use the arrow and Tab keys to move to each button in each type message
   box. Activing the Help pushButtons will cause messages 
   about the Help callback to be displayed in the term window.
   When you use the Tab key to move into a new message box, a message
   indicating the focus has arrived there, will be printed in the xterm
   window.
C)

#) Press and hold MB1 in a pushButton. Move pointer
   out of pushButton. Move pointer back into pushButton.
   PushButton should appear pressed in when pointer is
   in it and popped out when pointer is not in it.
   Release MB1. 
C)

#) Press the <osfHelp> key.
   Help message should appear in the term window. 
#) Raise the term window. Term window should
   partially obscure the client window. Raise the client window.
   Resize larger and smaller.

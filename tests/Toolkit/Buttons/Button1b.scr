# HISTORY
# 

# This test ensures that the ArrowButton, PushButton, and ToggleButton
#   correctly change visually and stay in the correct state after calls
#   to the widgets' action procs.
# The instructions that follow assume you are running with a keyboardFocus
#   Policy (not Window Manager Focus) of XmEXPLICIT. If you are running in 
#   XmPOINTER focus policy, the instructions are not applicible.
# A window with an ArrowButton, a PushButton and a ToggleButton should
#   be visible.  They should be in a 'disarmed' state.

# The buttons should be armed.
# From the right hand side of the window, move the pointer in to and out of
#   each widget in turn: Arrow, PushButton, then ToggleButton. There should be
#   NO change when the pointer moves in, but when the pointer moves out of the
#   widget, it should disarm.

#) This is a test of the operation of the toggle button indicator.  
   A toggle button with a small pixmap and a push button should now be
   displayed.  Notice the size of the toggle indicator.
#) Click MB1 on the push button labelled "Cycle Pixmaps".  The pixmap on the
   toggle button should change.  This pixmap will be larger than the
   original pixmap.  The indicator should resize itself to remain in
   proportion to the pixmap height.
#) Click MB1 on the push button again.  Again, the pixmap will change and 
   the indicator will grow in proportion to its size.
#) Click MB1 one more time.  The pixmap returns to its original size and the
   indicator shrinks along with it.
C)

#) A Menu Bar is generated which contains a pulldown menu.  Using MB1,
   press on the MENU cascade button on the Menu Bar and do not release the
   button.  The Pulldown menu appears.

#) Notice that all of the toggle buttons in the Pulldown menu have the
   same indicator size.  Keeping MB1 pressed, move the pointer over
   "Button_A".  Release MB1.

#) Call up the pulldown menu again.  The label of the top button in the
   menu has been changed to "A New Label".  The indicator on this toggle 
   button should remain the same as the other buttons in the Pulldown menu.

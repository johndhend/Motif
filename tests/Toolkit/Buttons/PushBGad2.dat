   'Push Here'. All other resources will be set by default.

   to 5 which will place a second shadow region around the pushbutton
   to visually mark it as a default button. 
#) Click MB1 on the pushbutton again. Now, showAsDefault will be set at 10 and
   and the shadow region around the pushbutton will grow to 10 pixels.

#) The background color of the manager is now Yellow. The background
   color of the Push Button should also be changed.  The shadows are
   still blue.

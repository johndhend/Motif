# HISTORY
# 

# This is a simple test of traversal behaviors.  The two boxed groups of 
#  widgets are tab groups. You can move between the groups by pressing TAB 
#  or Shift-TAB. Within each group, move between the buttons by using the 
#  up and down arrow keys. Use the space key to activate (depress)
#  the buttons. Try moving amongst the buttons and back and forth between
#  the tab groups.

# Using the up and down arrow keys, move to the button labeled "arrow2".  
#  The button should now have the highlight around it.  Press return, and 
#  this pushbutton will become unmanaged and the highlight should move to 
#  the button labelled "arrow3".

# Now move up to the button labelled "arrow1" and press return.
#  The "arrow2" button will be managed and visible again, but the
#  highlight should remain around "arrow1".

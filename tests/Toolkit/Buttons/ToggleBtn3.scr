# HISTORY

# This is a simple test of toggle button behaviors. To toggle a 
#  toggle button, click anywhere on the label or on the indicator.  

# Click on ToggleButton1. The indicator should fill to show it is on.
# Toggle Button 1 uses a large font and its indicator is sized proportionally. 

# Press MB1 down on ToggleButton1, then move outside the window and release
# the button. The toggle indicator will change when you press the button 
# and should revert when you move outside the window. 

# Move the pointer back over ToggleButton1, and use both the return key and
# the space bar to toggle the indicator.

# the mouse or the keyboard, as you did with ToggleButton1. The indicator 
# should not fill with a new color, but the top and bottom shadows 
# should change.

# Leave this button ON before you continue
# It should remain highlighted for the remainder of the test.

/* test for PIRS 2651 */

@) This test confirms that ToggleButton widgets and gadgets locate the toggle
indicators centered vertically regardless of the XmNlabelType
of the toggle and the indicator size, when XmNindicatorOn is true. 
@) You should see 8 pairs of toggle buttons, alternatively text and pixmap,
with the pairs each composed of a toggle widget and a toggle gadget.

#) The first pair (string) should appear with a large indicator matched 
to the size of the font. 
Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.
#) The second pair (pixmap) should appear with a smaller indicator.
Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.
#) The third pair (string) should appear without an indicator.
#) The fourth pair (pixmap) should appear without an indicator.
#) The fifth pair (string) should appear with a smaller indicator (of size 12).
Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.
#) The sixth pair (pixmap) should appear with a smaller indicator (of size 12).
Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.
#) The seventh pair (string) should appear without any indicator.
#) The eighth pair (pixmap) should appear without any indicator.

C)

#) Now click on each button. The XmNlabelType should change. Confirm that
no widget suddenly adds an indicator where one should not be and that no
indicator disappears. 
Also confirm that the indicator is centered vertically for those widgets in
and gadgets in which it appears.

#) Repeat to change them back. The main window should appear as it did 
initially.

C)

#) 20 toggle Buttons should appear with different background colors 
   starting with yellow.
C)
#) The Row Column lays itself out horizontally and
border width of each child grows.
C)
#) The border width grows again.
#) At some point, probably this panel or the next depending on your
screen, the Row Column widget will wrap to the next line.
C)
#) The border width grows again.
C)
E)

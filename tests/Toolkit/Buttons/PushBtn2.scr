# HISTORY
# 

#  This test confirms that setting the resources 
#   XmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness and XmNshowAsDefault on
#   a PushButton and PushButtonGadget before they are realized does not 
#   cause those widgets to draw into an unrealized window.

#  You should see the two objects displayed. 
#   If no X errors (BadDrawable from X_PolyFillRectangle request) 
#   have been reported, the test has passed.

# A client with a pushbutton should appear. It should be labeled
#  'Push Here' with marginWidth and marginHeight set at 20.
#  All other resources will be set by default. 

# Click MB1 on the pushbutton. The pushbutton should set showAsDefault
#  to 5 which will place a second shadow region around the pushbutton
#  to visually mark it as a default button. 

# Click MB1 on the pushbutton again. Now, showAsDefault will be set at 10 and
#  and the shadow region around the pushbutton will grow to 10 pixels.

#  Try both 'R' and 'r', to verify for case sensitivity.

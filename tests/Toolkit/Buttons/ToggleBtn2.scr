#  /* test for PIRS 2651 */
# This test confirms that ToggleButton widgets and gadgets locate the toggle
#  indicators centered vertically regardless of the XmNlabelType
#  of the toggle and the indicator size, when XmNindicatorOn is true. 
#  You should see 8 pairs of toggle buttons, alternatively text and pixmap,
#  with the pairs each composed of a toggle widget and a toggle gadget.

# The first pair (string) should appear with a large indicator matched 
#  to the size of the font. 

# Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.

# The second pair (pixmap) should appear with a smaller indicator.
#  Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.

# The third pair (string) should appear without an indicator.

# The fourth pair (pixmap) should appear without an indicator.

# The fifth pair (string) should appear with a smaller indicator (of size 12).
#  Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.

# The sixth pair (pixmap) should appear with a smaller indicator (of size 12).
#  Confirm that the indicator is centered vertically.

# The seventh pair (string) should appear without any indicator.
# The eighth pair (pixmap) should appear without any indicator.

# Now click on each button. The XmNlabelType should change. Confirm that
#  no widget suddenly adds an indicator where one should not be and that no
#  indicator disappears. 
#  Also confirm that the indicator is centered vertically for those widgets in
#  and gadgets in which it appears.

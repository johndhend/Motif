#) A client with a form should appear. The form should be about
   200x200 pixels and have a scrollbar along the right edge
   extending halfway down the form.  It should also have a
   scrollbar along the bottom edge extending to the x location
   of the vertical scrollbar. 
#) Resize the client window several times.  You should see the
   vertical scrollbar remain on the right edge of the form and
   maintain its original height.  The horizontal scrollbar should
   remain on the bottom edge of the form, but grow horizontally
   so that its right edge always extends to the x location of the
   vertical scrollbar. 
#) Iconify and Normalize the client.  The scrollbars should reappear
   when the client is normalized.

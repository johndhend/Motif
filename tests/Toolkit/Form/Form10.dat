#) A client with a form widget containing a ArrowButton widget will
   appear.  The ArrowButton will fill the form. 
!) 
C)

#) The ArrowButton will now have a topOffset of 10, a bottomOffset
   of 30, a leftOffset of 20, and a rightOffset of 40. 
!) 
C)

#) The form will now have top/bottom/left/right Attachment set to
   XmATTACH_POSITION, and the ArrowButton will have a leftPosition of
   10, a rightPosition of 90, a topPosition of 25, and a
   bottomPosition of 75. 
#) Note that the above resource settings would result in a
   ArrowButton widget which was centered in the form, and was 80% as
   wide as the form, and 50% as tall as the form.  However, since
   the offsets set earlier are still in effect, the ArrowButton will
   be further indented 10 from the top, 30 from the bottom, 20 from
   the left, and 40 from the right of the form.

#) The form will now have a fractionBase of 10, and the ArrowButton
   will have a leftPosition of 1, a rightPosition of 9, a
   topPosition of 3, and a bottomPosition of 8. 
#) Note that the above resource settings would result in a
   ArrowButton widget which was centered in the form, and was 80% as

#) A client with a form should appear. The form should be about
   500x100 pixels, and should have three ArrowButtons within
   it.  The form will have left/right Attachment set to
   XmATTACH_POSITION, and topAttachment set to XmATTACH_FORM for
   the first two arrows and bottomAttachment set to XmATTACH_FORM
   for the third arrow.  The  first arrow will have a leftPosition
   of 10, a rightPosition of 30, and a topOffset of 20.  The second
   arrow will have a leftPosition of 40, a rightPosition of 60, and
   a topOffset of 0.  The third arrow will have a leftPosition of
   70, a rightPosition of 90, and a bottomOffset of 5.
!) 
#) Note that the above resource settings will result in ArrowButton
   widgets which are each 20% as wide as the form, and separated
   horizontally from the form and eachother by a space 10% as wide
   as the form.  In addition, the first two widgets will each be
   offset from the top of the form, and the third widget will be
   offset from the bottom of the form, by the amounts listed above. 
!) 
#) Resize the client several times. You should see the arrows move
   and resize,  but retain the same relative horizontal positions
   and sizes. 
!) 
#) Iconify and Normalize the client window.

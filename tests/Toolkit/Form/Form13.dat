#) A client with a form should appear. The form should be about
   200x100 pixels, and should have three ArrowButtons within it.
   The form will have top/bottom/left/right Attachment set to
   XmATTACH_POSITION.  Each arrow will have a topPosition of 25 and
   a bottomPosition of 75.  The first arrow will have a leftPosition
  of 10 and a rightPosition of 30.  The second arrow will have a
   leftPosition of 40 and a rightPosition of 60.  The third arrow
   will have a leftPosition of 70 and a rightPosition of 90.
!) 
#) Note that the above resource settings will result in ArrowButton
   widgets which are centered vertically in the form, are each 20%
   as wide as the form, 50% as tall as the form, and separated
   horizontally from the form and eachother by a space 10% as wide
   as the form. 
!) 
#) Resize the client several times. You should see the arrows move
   and resize,  but retain the same relative positions and sizes. 
!) 
#) Iconify and Normalize the client window.

# HISTORY
#) A client with a form should appear. The form should be about
#   200x100 pixels, and should have three ArrowButtons within it.
#   The form will have top/bottom/left/right Attachment set to
#   XmATTACH_POSITION.  Each arrow will have a topPosition of 25 and
#   a bottomPosition of 75.  The first arrow will have a leftPosition
#  of 10 and a rightPosition of 30.  The second arrow will have a
#   leftPosition of 40 and a rightPosition of 60.  The third arrow
#   will have a leftPosition of 70 and a rightPosition of 90.
#   Note that the above resource settings will result in ArrowButton
#   widgets which are centered vertically in the form, are each 20%
#   as wide as the form, 50% as tall as the form, and separated
#   horizontally from the form and eachother by a space 10% as wide
#   as the form. 
#) Resize the client several times. You should see the arrows move
#  and resize,  but retain the same relative positions and sizes. 
#) Iconify and Normalize the client window.

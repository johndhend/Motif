#) A client with a form should appear. The form should be about
   200x100 pixels, and should have a scrollbar centered within it.
   The form will have top/bottom/left/right Attachment set to
   XmATTACH_POSITION, and the scrollbar will have a leftPosition
   of 10, a rightPosition of 90, a topPosition of 25, and a
   bottomPosition of 75. 
#) Note that the above resource settings will result in a scrollbar
   widget which is centered in the form, and is 80% as wide as the
   form, and 50% as tall as the form. 
#) Resize the client several times. You should see the scrollbar
   move and resize,  but retain the same relative position and size. 
#) Iconify and Normalize the client window.  The scrollbar should
   reappear when the client is normalized.

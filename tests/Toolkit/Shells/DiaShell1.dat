/* Test PIR4340 */
#) A client containing a MessageBox Dialog should appear. The MessageBox
   should have a messageString of \"DialogStyle Unmanaged Test\", the OK 
   button should have a label of \"UnManage\". The dialogStyle will be
   XmDIALOG_SYSTEM_MODAL, which will cause the cursor's symbol to change
   and will disallow input (including focus) in any window on your 
   system other than the Message Dialog.

#) Press MB1 on the Unmanage button of the dialog. The Message Dialog 
   should be Unmanaged and should \"pop down\". You now should be able to
   have focus in any window and the cursor should change back to the 
   default cursor.

C)
/* End test PIR4340 */


#) A client window should appear with three dialog boxes
   stacked on top of each other in the left corner 

C)


#) Move the three dialog boxes so they are not on top
   of each other and not on top of DiaShell1 window. 

#) Iconify the client window. 

#) Normalize the client window.

C)


#) Click MB1 on OK in MessageBox1. MessageBox1 should disappear. 

#) Click MB1 on OK in MessageBox2. MessageBox2 should disappear. 

#) Click MB1 on OK in MessageBox3. MessageBox3 should disappear. 

C) 


#) A dialog shell should appear with several different labels.
   No errors should occur.

C)


#) The dialog shell with different labels should disappear.

#) There should be a control panel with pushbuttons "Create FormDialog1",
   "Manage FormDialog1", "Unmanage FormDialog1".

C)


#) Click MouseBtn1 on "Create FormDialog1".

#) Click MouseBtn1 on "Manage FormDialog1".

#) You should see a formdialog window with the title "FormDialog1" and
   a pushbutton "Post FormDialog2".

#) Move "FormDialog1" window to 200, 200.

#) Click MouseBtn1 on "Post FormDialog2".

#) You should see a new formdialog window with the title "FormDialog2"
   and size 100x100, on top of FormDialog1.

C)


#) Click MouseBtn1 on "Unmanage FormDialog1".

#) Both "FormDialog1" and "FormDialog2" windows should disappear.

#) Click MouseBtn1 on "Manage FormDialog1".

#) Both "FormDialog1" and "FormDialog2" windows should reappear.

#) If only "FormDialog1" reappears, then PIR3006 has not been fixed.
   Click MouseBtn1 on "Post FormDialog2". You should see the message
   "FormDialog2 already managed" on the term window.

/* Test CR5043 */

#) If, after clicking on MouseBtn1, "FormDialog2" reappears and the 
   message "FormDialog2 being managed" on the term window, the PIR5043 
   has been fixed.

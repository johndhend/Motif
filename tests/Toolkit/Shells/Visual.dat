 * HISTORY

#) This test tests XmNvisual

C)

#) We try to create visuals from all six visual classes for the current 
   display. At least one of the conversions must succeed. Any failures will
   send a warning to stderr that can be ignored. See that the table 
   in stdout has at least one of the entries as \"Yes\". Then, for each 
   successful conversion, we attempt to change the value of the resource 
   XmNvisual in the shell widget. In stdout, for each attempted change, the 
   string \"Visual successfully modified\" must appear.

E)

@) The text widget's contents read "Some Text."  If Adobe fonts are
installed on your system, then the text widget
will use the Adobe courier 14 font.
Otherwise the default font will be used.
@) There should be a warning in the stdout window indicating an 
illegal value for the rep type XmRScrollingPolicy.  This should
be followed by a message indicating that
the GetValues of scrollingPolicy now equals XmAPPLICATION_DEFINED.
#) Select a few letters in the middle of the text by dragging
   MB1.  Now, cut the selection using by pressing the osfCut key.
   The remaining text should be free of any garbage pixels in 
   the area where the selection was.
C)
#) Move the pointer into the client window after the text already
   present and click MB1.  Next, type Return and the following:
!)
      Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.<CR>
      Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.<CR>

#) Type the next line, and note that after the horizontal scrollbar
   slider reaches the right side of its trough, it becomes smaller
   with each additional keystroke:
!)
      All the king's horses and all the king's men.

#) Again, move the pointer into the client window after the last
   sentence you just typed and type Return.  Note that the vertical
   scrollbar slider gets smaller.
C)
#) Move the vertical scrollbar's slider all the way up to the top.
#) Resize the window much larger.  The scrollbar sliders should fill
   the troughs again.
#) Move the cursor into the client window and verify that the I-beam is
   visible in the newly exposed text areas.
C)
#) Try the following MB1 multiple-click tests,
   and verify the selections:
!)
      Single click -- places insertion cursor.
      Double click -- selects word.
      Triple click -- selects line.
      Quadruple click -- selects all the text.

C)

@) The following test is concerned about using MCtrlKUp and MCtrlKDown
to move the cursor back and forth between paragraphs, which was
reported as a bug (# 3145).
!)
#) Move the cursor to the end of the line. Enlarge the window in order
   to see ten or more lines. Type the following lines, typing a space
   where the instructions indicate \"_\".
!)
        <CR>
        <CR>
        a<CR>
        <CR>
        _x_<CR>
        b

#) With the cursor located after the letter \"b\", press <Ctrl> KUp.
   The cursor should move to the position before the letter \"x\".
   Press <Ctrl> KUp again. The cursor should now be located
   before the letter \"a\".
   Pressing <Ctrl> KDown should move the cursor back in front of
   the letter \"x\". 
   Pressing <Ctrl> KDown again should move the cursor after the
   letter \"b\".

C)
@) The following two panels are a test case for CR 5166.
#) The text widget should now have two lines of text displayed.
Move the vertical scrollbar down to the bottom of the trough.

C)

#) The text \"Spider Lives!" should now be displayed. 

C)
E)

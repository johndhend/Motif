@) Two text widgets were created using the helvetica1 font.
#) Click on the helvetica2 font to change both widgets to the larger font.
Both widgets should grow in width but their columns should remain
unchanged.  The width and column data is displayed in the stdout window.
#) Click on the helvetica1 font to change the widgets back to the
smaller font.  Both widgets should shrink in width and keep the
same column count.

#) Press and hold MB1 on the helvetica2 ToggleButton.  While it is 
being held, the font should change for the text widget.
#) Without moving the mouse, release MB1.  Confirm that the ToggleButton
indicator for the helvetica2 button appears depressed and all other
ToggleButtons do not.
#) Press and hold MB1 on the helvetica3 ToggleButton.  While it is
being held, the font should change again for the text widget.
#) Move the pointer outside the test window and release the MB1.
The ToggleButton indicator for the helvetica2 button should still appear
depressed and the indicator for helvetica3 should not.

@) A resizable Text widget is displayed. 
@) The following resources have been set:

#  @) The client window should have two TextField widgets and
#  one Text widget.
#  The first TextField has XmNresizeWidth set to False.  The second has
#  it set to True.  The Text widget also has it set to True.
#  /* test case for PIR 2914 */
#  #) Type "all the king's horses and all the king's men" into the first 
#  TextField widget.  For each character typed that exceeds the width
#  of the TextField, the text should shift to the left one character 
#  to keep the newly typed character in view.

#  #) Type the same string into the second TextField widget.  The behavior should
#  be identical.  In particular, the text should not jump more than one
#  character at a time to the left as the new text in entered on the right.

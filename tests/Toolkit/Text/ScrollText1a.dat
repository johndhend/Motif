the text and the horizontal scrollbar should be flushed to the right.
#) Click MB1 anywhere in the text widget.
#) Press the sequence Shift-osfPageDown, and the text will change.
#) Press the sequence Shift-osfPageDown again and the text will change back.
C)
#) Place the pointer in the text widget again, and press the Help key.
   An information box will appear. Press the Dismiss button.

/* test case for PIR 2574 */
#) Give the text window the focus.  Click MB1 after the last word in the
   text widget.
#) Type in ten lines of lines of new text.  The scrollbar slider should be
at the bottom of the trough.
#) Iconify and deiconify the window or otherwise cause it to be re-exposed.
#) Confirm that the location of the text does not change within the window.
/* end of test case for PIR 2574 */

/* test case for PIR 2127 */
@) The text widget should now be displayed in the "variable" font
   and the string should have changed.
#) Click MB1 just before any of the j's in the string and type a
   few spaces.  Verify that no pieces of the character glyphs remain
   where the spaces now are.

/* test case for PIR 4120 */

@) The text widget has been destroyed and recreated.  It was created as a
Scrolled Text widget with editMode == XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT, rows == 3.
#) Confirm that there is no vertical scrollbar present.
#) Click on the togglebutton to switch the EditMode to
XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT.  Confirm that a vertical scrollbar is generated and
that it appears to the left of the text.
Use the vertical scrollbar to scroll through the text.
#) Click on the togglebutton again to switch the EditMode back to 
XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT.  The vertical scrollbar should disappear and the text
widget should return to only displaying 1 line.

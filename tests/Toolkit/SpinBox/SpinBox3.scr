# HISTORY

# #) A SpinBox will appear on your screen. It will have 2 children of the
#    type specified on the command line, one of type NUMERIC, and the other of
#    type STRING. There will be a Separator between the 2 children.
# #) Both arrows of the SpinBox should be sensitive.
# #) The two arrows should be at the leftmost edge of the SpinBox,
#    and horizontally adjacent to each other.
# #) The height of the arrows should be 25 pixels.
# #) The visible item in the STRING child should be "February". The
#    visible item in the NUMERIC child should be 2.

# #) Set the focus to the STRING child.
# #) Press MB1 on the right-pointing arrow. Hold it down for a few seconds.
#    Release MB1. The value displayed in the STRING child should be incremented
#    by 1; i.e, "March" will now be the displayed value. The valueChangedCallback
#    should be invoked twice with the reasons XmCR_OK and XmCR_SPIN_NEXT. The
#    modifyVerifyCallback should be invoked with the reason XmCR_SPIN_NEXT.

# #) Set the focus to the NUMERIC child.
# #) Click on the left-pointing arrow until the value displayed in the
#    NUMERIC child is 3. You should not be able to decrement the value any
#    further. The value should wrap to 15 after 3.
# #) Click on the right-pointing arrow until the value displayed in the
#    NUMERIC widget is 15. You should not be able to go to increment the value
#    any further. The value should wrap to 3 after 15.

#    NUMERIC child  should again be incremented by 3.
#    The reason for the valueChangedCallback and the modifyVerifyCallback
#    should be XmCR_SPIN_NEXT.
#    Release MB1. The reason for the valueChangedCallback should be XmCR_OK.

# #) The two arrows of the SpinBox should be at the rightmost edge of the
#    SpinBox, and horizontally adjacent to each other.
# #) The height of the arrows should now be 50 pixels.
# #) The visible item in the STRING child should be "June". The
#    visible item in the NUMERIC child should be 0.7. (The number of
#    decimal places that the integer value is displayed with has been increased
#    to 1.)
# #) Set the focus to the STRING child. The right-pointing arrow should be
#    insensitive, and the left-pointing arrow, sensitive.
# #) Set the focus to the NUMERIC child. The right-pointing arrow should be
#    sensitive, and the left-pointing arrow, insensitive.
# #) With the focus on the NUMERIC child, press MB1 on the right-pointing
#    arrow. Hold it down. After about 10 seconds, the value displayed in the
#    NUMERIC child should be incremented to 0.8.
#    Do not release MB1. After about 10 seconds, the value displayed in the
#    NUMERIC child  should again be incremented to 0.9.
#    The reason for the valueChangedCallback and the
#    modifyVerifyCallback should be XmCR_SPIN_NEXT.

# #) Set the focus to the NUMERIC child. The right arrow should be sensitive,
#    and the left, insensitive.
# #) The value in the NUMERIC child should still be 0.9.
# #) With the focus on the NUMERIC child, press MB1 on the right-pointing arrow,
#    and hold. The value displayed in the NUMERIC child should remain the same.
#    Release MB1. The value in the NUMERIC child should increment to 1.9 with
#    no perceptible delay.

/* 
 * HISTORY
 */

@)  A SpinBox with four text fields should be displayed.
    The current layout direction is RIGHT_TO_LEFT.
    The XmNarrowLayout resource is set as XmARROWS_BEGINNING, therefore
    the increment and decrement arrows should be displayed to the right
    of the text fields.

#)  Set focus on the first text field which displays \"Mon\".
    Click on the left arrow button to increment the weekday to \"Fri\".

#)  Move the focus to the next text field which displays \"15\".
    Click on the right arrow button to decrement the day value
    to \"8\".
    
#)  Move the focus to the next text field which displays \"Jan\".
    Click KLeft to increment the month to \"Oct\".

#)  Move focus to the last text field which displays \"1995\".
    Click KRight to decrement the year to \"1993\". 

#)  The final date should read: Fri 8 Oct 1993.

C)

#)  XmNdefaultArrowSensitivity is set to XmARROWS_DECREMENT_SENSITIVE.
    Since the layout direction is RIGHT_TO_LEFT, the right-pointing
    arrow should be sensitive.

C)

#)  XmNdefaultArrowSensitivity is set to XmARROWS_INCREMENT_SENSITIVE.
    Since the layout direction is RIGHT_TO_LEFT, the left-pointing
    arrow should be sensitive.

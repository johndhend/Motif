#) A SpinBox will appear on your screen. It will have 2 children of the
   type specified on the command line, one of type NUMERIC, and the other of 
   type STRING. There will be a Separator between the 2 children.
#) Both arrows of the SpinBox should be sensitive.
#) The two arrows should be at the leftmost edge of the SpinBox,
   and horizontally adjacent to each other.
#) The height of the arrows should be 25 pixels.
#) The visible item in the STRING child should be "February". The
   visible item in the NUMERIC child should be 2.
#) Set the focus to the STRING child.
#) Press MB1 on the right-pointing arrow. Hold it down for a few seconds.
   Release MB1. The value displayed in the STRING child should be incremented
   by 1; i.e, "March" will now be the displayed value. The valueChangedCallback
   should be invoked twice with the reasons XmCR_OK and XmCR_SPIN_NEXT. The
   modifyVerifyCallback should be invoked with the reason XmCR_SPIN_NEXT.
C)

#) Set the focus to the NUMERIC child.
#) Click on the left-pointing arrow until the value displayed in the
   NUMERIC child is 3. You should not be able to decrement the value any 
   further. The value should wrap to 15 after 3.
#) Click on the right-pointing arrow until the value displayed in the
   NUMERIC widget is 15. You should not be able to go to increment the value
   any further. The value should wrap to 3 after 15.
C)

#) Press MB1 on the right-pointing arrow. After about 10 seconds, 
   the value displayed in the NUMERIC child should be incremented by 3.
   Do not release MB1. After about 10 seconds, the value displayed in the 
   NUMERIC child  should again be incremented by 3.
   The reason for the valueChangedCallback and the modifyVerifyCallback 
   should be XmCR_SPIN_NEXT. 
   Release MB1. The reason for the valueChangedCallback should be XmCR_OK. 
C)


#) The two arrows of the SpinBox should be at the rightmost edge of the 
   SpinBox, and horizontally adjacent to each other.
#) The height of the arrows should now be 50 pixels.
#) The visible item in the STRING child should be "June". The
   visible item in the NUMERIC child should be 0.7. (The number of
   decimal places that the integer value is displayed with has been increased
   to 1.)
#) Set the focus to the STRING child. The right-pointing arrow should be
   insensitive, and the left-pointing arrow, sensitive.
#) Set the focus to the NUMERIC child. The right-pointing arrow should be
   sensitive, and the left-pointing arrow, insensitive.
#) With the focus on the NUMERIC child, press MB1 on the right-pointing 
   arrow. Hold it down. After about 10 seconds, the value displayed in the 
   NUMERIC child should be incremented to 0.8. 
   Do not release MB1. After about 10 seconds, the value displayed in the 
   NUMERIC child  should again be incremented to 0.9.
   The reason for the valueChangedCallback and the 
   modifyVerifyCallback should be XmCR_SPIN_NEXT.
C)


#) The two arrows should now be at either end of the SpinBox.
#) Set the focus to the STRING child. The left arrow should be sensitive,
   and the right, insensitive.
#) Set the focus to the NUMERIC child. The right arrow should be sensitive,
   and the left, insensitive.
#) The value of the numeric child should be 0.1. 
#) With the focus on the NUMERIC child, press MB1 on the right-pointing arrow,
   and hold. The value displayed in the NUMERIC child should remain the same.
   Release MB1. The value in the NUMERIC child should increment to 1.1 with 
   no perceptible delay.

#) The two arrows should now be at the leftmost edge of the SpinBox,
   and horizontally adjacent to each other.
#) Both arrows of the SpinBox should now be insensitive.
#) Set the focus in turn to the NUMERIC and STRING child. Both
   arrows should continue to be insensitive.
C)


#) The two arrows should now be at the rightmost edge of the SpinBox,
   and horizontally adjacent to each other.
#) Both arrows of the SpinBox should be insensitive.
C)

#) The two arrows should now be to the right of the text widgets, with an
   upward pointing arrow displayed above a downward one.
#) Both arrows should be insensitive. (SpinBox3 TP 8: Motif/CDE

#) The two arrows should be to the left of the text widgets, one above the
   other.

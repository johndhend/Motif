 * HISTORY
 */

#) This test should have been run with the flag "-u 2".
#) A SpinBox with 2 Text children will appear on your screen. One will
   be STRING and one NUMERIC.
#) The item displayed in the STRING child should be "B".
#) The item displayed in the NUMERIC child should be 0.03.
#) The two arrows should be at the right of the Text widgets, and horizontally
   adjacent to each other.
#) Set focus to the STRING child. Only the decrement (left) arrow should be 
sensitive.
#) Set focus to the NUMERIC child. Only the decrement (left) arrow should be
sensitive.
#) No warnings should appear on the term window, indicating uninstalled
   or incorrect resource converters.

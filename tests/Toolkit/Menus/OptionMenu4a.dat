#) A client window containing a Form widget with nine OptionMenu
   children will appear.  The window will be located 350 pixels down
   from the top left corner of the display.  Click on the buttons
   labeled 'Himalayan', 'Siamese', and 'E. Shorthair' and
   you'll see the same (shared) menu pane.
      Note: there should be no warning messages in the xterm window. 
   The text should be rendered right to left.  Any toggle button
   indicators should appear to the left side of the option menu. 
#) Move the pointer into the client window.  Traverse from button to
   button using the down arrow key.  The focus should move through
   the buttons in the following order:
      Himalayan, Siamese, D. Shorthair
      Maine Cat, Burmese, E. Shorthair,
      Turkish Van,  Persian,
      Russian Blue.

   Button3, and OptionMenu3 sets XmNmenuHistory to Button2.

   to the left of the A Long Item label. 
#  Verify the position of the pulldown menu is to the right of the
   OptionMenu indicator.

   and the rightmost column of widgets widgets will shrink to fit in
   the window.

#) Press the "destroyMe" button.  This button will disappear, and
   the rest of the buttons in the region will rearrange themselves
   to fill in the gap. 
#) Move to the "sensitivity" button and select it.  This
   button's label will change to "Make Blue Button Sensitive".
   The label on "blueButton" will change.  Move among the buttons.
   You will not be able to traverse to "blueButton". 
#) Select the "Change Tab Group" button.  This button's label
   will change to "Add TabGroup".  The third region will
   be removed from the list of tab groups.  The focus will move to
   the next region, and you will not be able to reach the third
   region with the tab key.

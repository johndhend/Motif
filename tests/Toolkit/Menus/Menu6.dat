/* test for PIRS 1098 */

@) This test confirms that the Label Widget/Gadgets subclasses correctly
resize narrower after the XmNacceleratorText resource is changed to NULL.
@) You should see a small window with several menus in it. 

#) Pop up each menu; note
that the selectable items have acceleratorText displayed. 
#) For each item, select the item; doing so sets acceleratorText to NULL. 
Confirm that the item has shrunk in horizontal size appropriately by popping 
up the menu again.

C)

#) For each item, select the item again; doing so resets the acceleratorText
to a non-NULL string larger than the original. 
Confirm that some value for acceleratorText has reappeared and that the 
widget has grown in horizontal size appropriately.

#) Bring up the Arrange menu. It is a 2-dimensional menu with   a cascade 
   button. Use the arrow keys to move down to the cascade button and press
   return.  The submenu should pop up. Use the left arrow key to unpost the
   submenu. Post it again. Hit ESC to unpost the last menu.
   (HINT: try this on an R3 server!)   Use the up-arrow key to move off 
   the cascade button.
#) Use the right arrow key and the Layout Menu should popup. This is a 
   horizontal menu which has the buttons very close together.  Left and 
   right arrow keys should move you between the buttons in this menu. 
   Up and down arrows should move you to the Arrange Menu.
#) Unpost all menus. Btn1-click on the Arrange cascade. Move the pointer over
   any other button in the menu other than the cascade button. Press MB1. The
   button you are over should get the highlight and the button which had the
   highlight previously should lose it. Move the pointer in and out of the menu
   with the button pressed down. The highlight should disappear then reappear.

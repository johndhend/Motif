# HISTORY

# The RowColumn has been created as a child of a DrawingArea widget.

# /*  Test for PIR 3473 */

# Verify that if XmNpacking is set to XmPACK_TIGHT, that setting XmNnumColumns
#  will have no effect.

# Change the button Label String to be "New Value".

# Now change the number of children to be 10.  10 children should appear
#   vertically in the RowColumn, all entitled "New Value".

# Verify that XmNpacking is XmPACK_TIGHT.  Now set XmNnumColumns to 2.
#   No change should occur.

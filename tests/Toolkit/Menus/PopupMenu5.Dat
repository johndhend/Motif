#) This test looks at the uses of XmNwhichButton and XmNmenuPost.  
#) A client should appear with two pushbuttons - "Popup with whichButton"
   and "Popup with menupost".  PopupMenus have been associated with the
   first pushButton via XmNwhichButton.  Two different popups should appear
   when pressing MB1 and MB3.  
#) PopupMenus have been associated with the second pushButton via XmNmenuPost.
   Two different popups should appear when pressing MB1 and MB3.  (Note: The 
   two popups for the first button should be different from the two popups 
   for the second button).
#) Verify that MB1 and MB3 presses in both buttons cause popups to be
   posted.
C) 


#) Note that no warnings should appear in the term window.
#) The same test occurs; however, XmNmenuPost and XmNwhichButton have been
   specified at SetValues time.
#) Verify that MB1 and MB3 presses in both buttons cause popups to be
   posted.
C)

	
#) Note that no warnings should appear in the term window.
#) A BulletinBoard with a PushButton will appear.  An event handler has been
   set for ButtonPress events on the PushButton and the BulletinBoard.  
   A popupMenu has been
   created as a child of the BulletinBoard.  The event handler will manage
   the popupMenu if MB3 has been pressed.

#) Click MB1 in the pushButton. The push button should press in and out.
   A message should appear in the term window,
   saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button 1".

#) Click MB3 in the pushButton.  A message should appear in the term window,
   saying that "whichButton = 3, handler called for Button3".  A popupMenu
   should appear.  Use MB3 to pop down the popupMenu.

#) Now click MB1 and MB3 in the bulletinBoard, but not in the pushButton.
   Messages should be posted for both button clicks and the popup should
   be posted with MB3.
C)


#) Now whichButton has been set to 3 and there is NO event handler set for
   ButtonPress events on the Bulletin Board, just an event handler on the
   pushButton.  Therefore, the popupMenuhas been created as a child of
   the pushButton.

   should appear.  Use MB3 to pop down the popupMenu.

   No messages should appear in the term window; no effect should happen from
   selecting in the bulletinBoard.

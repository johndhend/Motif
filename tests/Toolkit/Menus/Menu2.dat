#) A client window will appear with four row column widgets.  The
   first will contain four pushbuttons, the next two will each
   contain two option menu widgets, and the fourth will contain a
   toggle button, a push button and a menu bar.
#) Give focus to the client window. 
#) Select \"button1\" with MB1.  The button will be set insensitive.
   The text on top of the button next to the label \"OptionMenu1
   (called the menu history) will change to read \"option2a\". 
#) Click and hold down MB1 on the button next to the label
   \"OptionMenu2\".  Note that the \"3\" in \"option3b\" is
   underlined (indicating a mnemonic).  Release MB1. 
#) Select \"button2\" with MB1. 
#) Again click and hold down MB1 on the button next to the label
   \"OptionMenu2\".  Note that the \"3\" in \"option3b\" is no
   longer underlined. 
#) Subsequent selections of button2 will alternate between the two
   states described above. 
C)

#) Give focus to the client window. 
#) Select \"button3\" with MB1.  The option menu \"OptionMenu1\" will
   become insensitive. 
#) Again, select \"button3\" with MB1.  The option menu
   \"OptionMenu1\" will be set sensitive. 
#) Select \"button4\" with MB1.  The button will be set insensitive.
   The label for the option menu \"OptionMenu4\" will be changed to
   \"NewMenulabel\". 
#) Press and Hold MB1 on the Pixmap to the right of \"NewMenuLabel\". An
   Option Menu should appear with two Pixmaps. Move the pointer into
   the Smile Face Pixmap and release MB1. The Smile Face Pixmap should now
   be in the Selection area for \"NewMenuLabel\".

   gadgets and the pulldown containing widgets have entries which are
   the same size in height.

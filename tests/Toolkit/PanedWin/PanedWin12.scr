# HISTORY


#   A client with a Paned Window with ten pushbuttons will appear.
#   Each pane should be the same size.  Each button will have a label
#   consisting of PB plus two numbers separated by a colon.  The first
#   number indicates the order in which the buttons were created.  The
#   second number represents the value used to sort the buttons.  The buttons
#   should be sorted from top to bottom in descending order.

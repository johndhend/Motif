# HISTORY
#  Buttons 1 and 2 are 150 in height, Button 3 is 80. Pane minimum
#  is 100. Try to resize panes smaller than their mimimum. 
#  Press Alt-F8 (or pull down Size from the client's
#  window menu) and take note of the current height of the client.

#  Minimums for each pane now set at their current size. You should
#  not be able to make any pane smaller.
#  Because the Paned Window's top and bottom margins were increased,
#  the Pane and Shell should grow by about 100 pixels to
#  accomodate the mimimums and margins. 
#  Again take note of the current height of the client.

#  The sashes are doubled in size. Should be a net gain of about 22 pixels in
#  the size of the shell.

#  The separators should disappear. The sash is now as wide as the
#  Paned Window, making a sort of bar where the
#  separator and sash were. The children remain the same, except the minimum
#  size for each has been reduced by 50 so the sashes can be moved.

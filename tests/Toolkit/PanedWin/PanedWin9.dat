#) A client with a Paned Window with three pushbuttons will appear.
   The panes should be 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.

#) No constraints have been set, so all possible resizings should
   be allowed.

#) Return the panes to reasonable sizes and continue for more testing. 
C)

#) The maximum size of the first pane has been set to 100 pixels.

#) Verify this by resizing the panes.
C)

#) The maximum size of the first pane has been reset to the default
   while the maximum of the second has been set to 100 pixels.

#) Verify this by resizing the panes.

C)

#) The maximum size of the second pane has been reset to the default
   while the maximum of the third has been set to 100 pixels.

# HISTORY
# 

# A client containing a ScrolledWindow will appear. The ScrolledWindow
#  will contain a Form which will contain three Arrow Buttons. The Arrow
#  Buttons will be colored coral, violet, and yellow. The background
#  color of the ScrolledWindow will be AquaMarine which will apply to the
#  Scrollbars.

# The width and height of the ScrolledWindow will be 200x200.

# The coral Arrow Button will be attached to the Form on the top and the
#  left and will have a height of 200. 

# The violet Arrow Button will be
#  attached to the Form on the top, and on the left to the coral Arrow
#  Button with an offset of 10. Its width will be 200.

# The yellow Arrow Button will attached to the Form on the right and 
#  on the bottom. It will

#  violet Arrow Button both with offsets of 10. Its width and height will be
#  150.

# The top and bottom offsets on the yellow Arrow Button should increase
# from 10 to 25. This should cause the slider in vertical scrollbar to shrink.

# HISTORY
# 


#) A client window containing a scrolled window whose work window has
#   pushbuttons
#   should appear.  Not all of the pushbuttons should be visible.
#   A vertical scrollbar should appear at the right side of the client. 
#) Place focus in the window.  Now use KDown to traverse to all of the
#   buttons.  Once you reach the last visible button, KDown should 
#   scroll the Scrollbars such that the next button is visible.
#) When a button becomes visible due to traversing, it should reside
#   right next to (no margin) the clip window.
#) Continue typing KDown and make sure that the list scrolls back
#   to the first pushbutton.
#) Use the osfPageUp and osfPageDown keys to move the focus by pages.
#) Leave the focus in PushButton9.

# HISTORY
#!) This is a simple test of traversal behaviors.  
#) The five boxed groups of widgets are tab groups. 
#) Put the focus on the test client by clicking on the window border.
#) The button which is colored red should also have the focus and
#location cursor, as well as the default highlight.

#) You can move between the groups by hitting TAB or Shift-TAB. 
#) Each time you tab into the frame with the red button, the focus
#should go to that button, even if you use the arrow keys to move
#within that tab group.
#) Within each group, move between the buttons by using the up/down and 
#left/right arrow keys. 
#) Use the space key to activate (depress) the buttons. 
#) Try moving amongst the buttons and back and forth between the tab groups. 
#) The default button is btn1. When the focus is on a push button, that
#button will have the defaultButton shadow as well. But when the focus is
#moved to a non-push button, the defaultButton shadow moves back to btn1.
#) Before continuing, put the focus on misc1.

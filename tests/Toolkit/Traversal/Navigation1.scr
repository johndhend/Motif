# HISTORY
# 

# Case 1
#) A 1.1 Paned Window with buttons. Depress each button
#   using the space key. Focus should go to   sash after each button.
#) Move any sash with the up or down
#   arrow keys. If you hold down the key, the sash will cause
#   other sashes to move with it as it reaches them.

#   that this Paned Window
#   is a 1.1-style widget. Make each button insensitive and check
#   where the focus goes.

# Case 7

#change its label but not make it insensitive. Traverse around using arrow
#keys and make sure highlight moves properly.

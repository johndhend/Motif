#) The translations for the buttons and text widgets have been overridden so
that each time you press the TAB key, a message will be printed out saying
which widget currently has the focus, and in which tab group that widget is.
Then the focus will move to the next tab group.
#) Put the focus on several different buttons and hit tab. Verify that the
widget and tab group names printed out are the widget and tab groups you
are traversing FROM.
#) Try this also for the empty frames and the text widgets.
#) The traversal order should go from left to right, and from the top text
widget to the bottom one.
C)
#) A variety of tests have been performed and the results printed to
standard out. Review whether or not each test passed or failed.

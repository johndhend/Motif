#) The five boxed frames are tab groups explicitly set to XmNONE.  You can move
 between the groups by hitting the left/right up/down arrow keys. 
#) Use the return or space key to activate (depress) the buttons.
C)
@) The two-column Row Column has been set as a TAB_GROUP.
#) Tab should take you between btn1 in the leftmost row column and btn1 in
the third row column.
#) Use the Traverse button in this panel to move the focus to the NEXT widget.
#) Within each of the two tab groups,
the focus should move to the next widget in creation order, ie from btn2 to
btn3.

#) A client window containing a scrolled window whose work window has
   pushbuttons
   should appear.  Not all of the pushbuttons should be visible.
   A vertical scrollbar should appear at the right side of the client. 
#) Place focus in the window.  Now use KDown to traverse to all of the
   buttons.  Once you reach the last visible button, KDown should 
   scroll the Scrollbars such that the next button is visible.
#) When a button becomes visible due to traversing, it should reside
   right next to (no margin) the clip window.
#) Continue typing KDown and make sure that the list scrolls back
   to the first pushbutton.
#) Use the osfPageUp and osfPageDown keys to move the focus by pages.

#) Press KLeft.  The focus should move to PushButton5.  Press KRight.
   Focus should move back to PushButton9 and the widget should be
   *fully* visible.
#) Use KDown, KRight, KLeft, and KUp to traverse to the different 
   buttons.  Make sure that the window scrolls to accommodate traversing
   to a button which is not visible or totally visible.
#) When a button becomes visible due to traversing, it should reside
   5 pixels from the clip window.

#) The RowColumn now has two more children, a ToggleButton and a Text
   Field.  With the focus on PushButton1, press KTab.  The focus should
   move to the Text widget and the window should scroll to display the
   Text Widget fully.

   children.  Make sure that the window scrolls to accommodate traversing

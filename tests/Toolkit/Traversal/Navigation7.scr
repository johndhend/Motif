# HISTORY
#!) This is a test of traversal behaviors.
#) The four boxed groups of widgets are Frame/Row-Columns with
#  different TABbing attributes. 
#) You can move between all of 
#  the groups except the one on the right by hitting TAB or 
#  Shift-TAB.  Note the order of the traversal is not left to 
#  right totally.  
#) Within each TABable group, move between the 
#  buttons by using the up/down and right/left arrow keys. 
#) Use 
#  the space key to activate (depress) the buttons. 
#  Try moving amongst the buttons and back and forth between the 
#  tab groups.

#) Two empty frame/row columns have been added at the end. Try TABbing now.

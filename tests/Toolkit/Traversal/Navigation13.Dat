that each time you press the TAB key, a message will be printed out saying

Then the focus will move to the next tab group.
#) Put the focus on several different buttons and hit tab. Verify that the
widget and tab group names printed out are the widget and tab groups you
are traversing FROM.

widget to the bottom one.

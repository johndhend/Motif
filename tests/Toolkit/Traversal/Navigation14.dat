 * HISTORY
 */

#) Use arrow keys to traverse between the pushbutton, scrollbar and text.
#) The arrow keys will not take you to the RowColumn.
#) Tab will take you to the RowColumn.
#) Within the RowColumn, arrow keys will traverse the children.
C)
#) ScrollBar/Scale destroyed and recreated.
#) You should not be able to traverse to this widget with Tab or Arrows.
C)
#) Tab behavior should be as before.
#) Click on the scroll bar/scale and on other widgets. 
#) In no case should the focus move anywhere other than where you
place the focus.
C)
#) Now all the children of the Bulletin Board are tab groups.
#) The traversal order should be from left to right, top to bottom.
C)
#) Now all the children of the Bulletin Board are STICKY tab groups.
#) The traversal order should still be from left to right, top to bottom.
C)
#) An EXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP ScrolledList has been added.
#) The list is a tab group. The tab group status of the other widgets
   should not have changed.
#) The tab order should be counter-clockwise among the original children,
with the ScrolledList after the RowColumn.
C)
#) The text and button children have been returned to XmNONE navigationType.
#) The scroll bar/scale  and  RowColumn children were returned to XmTAB_GROUP.
#) Their parent bulletin board is now an EXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP.
#) The list remains an EXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP.
#) The list should remain a tab group. The other children should be
	traversable via the arrow keys.
#) The traversal order within the first tab group should be: DefaultButton; the three children of the row column; text; scale/scrollbar.
#) The second tab group is the scrolled list.

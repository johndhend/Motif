#) A client with a form should appear.
   Information about the form will be printed in the term
   window. The information includes width and height, vertical
   scrollbar's right offset, and the horizontal scrollbar's
   bottom offset. Depending on which flag you ran the test with, the data
   will be different. The correct values are (allow for rounding):
!)   Width   Height   Offset1   Offset2   MODE
    1990     743       491       491    early

#) The form should contain one pushbutton labeled 'pushB'. 
#) Press MB1 on the pushbutton. 
#) A second push button is managed. This button should be attached to the
top of the form with a 2-inch offset (really, the resource XmNverticalSpacing
is set). The existing button should be offset by 2 inches from the new button.
#) Press MB1 on the larger button. The new button will disappear and the
larger button will have its top attached to the form again. The verticalSpacing
resource has been reset to .2 inches.

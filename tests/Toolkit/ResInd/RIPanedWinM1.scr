# HISTORY
# A client with a empty paned window will appear. 
# Two lines of information will be printed in the term window.
# Both lines should be identical, with the width being close to 3000
# and the height being close to 4000. The values may
# not be exactly 3000 and 4000 because these values are
# in 1000THs of inches and a rounding must be performed
# to convert them to pixels.

# The paned window should now contain a pushbutton gadget. Info on
# the pushbutton will be printed in the term window. The width should
# be close to 3000, the height close to 1000, the shadow close to 50, the
# highlight close to 100, the margin width close to 3000, and the
# margin height close to 100. These are approximate because of rounding
# from 1000TH inches to pixels.

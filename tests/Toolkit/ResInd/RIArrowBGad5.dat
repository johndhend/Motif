 * HISTORY
 */
#) A client with a drawing area should appear. The drawing
   area will contain one ArrowButtonGadget at position
   100x250 in 1000TH_INCHES. One Toolkit Warning will be
   printed in the term window for an invalid unit type. 
#) Click MB1 on the ArrowButtonGadget. The arrow will
   disappear, leaving an empty drawing area. 
#) Run the test with the option \"-u -show_geom_bug\" to test 
   PIR 4250.  If the ArrowButtonGadget comes up at the same place 
   as before, PIR 4250 has been fixed.

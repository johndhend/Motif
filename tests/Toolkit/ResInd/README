	This directory has a list of tests which test the resolution
	indpendence support in the toolkit. In order to automate
	the tests which test resolution independent code, it was
	necessary to create this separate directory. The tests in
	this directory will have their visuals recorded in (and
	compared against) various different subdirectories
	corresponding to the various different resolution displays
	that we have in-house. The decision as to which subdirectory
	will be used, will be made by the RUN script depending on
	the resolution of the specified display.

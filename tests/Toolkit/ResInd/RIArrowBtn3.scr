# HISTORY


# A client with arrow button pointing upwards should appear. 
#  Two messages should be printed in term window. The first says that
#  the unitType is inches (1000TH_INCHES) and the size is set at 2000x1000.
#  The next line prints out the width and height. These
#  values are returned by XtGetValues. The width and height should be
#  approximately, but not exactly, the same as the values in the first line. 
#  This is because there is a rounding difference when converting 
#  1000TH_INCHES to pixels.

# The arrow button should change size 10 times. 
# Each time, the Expected and the Returned sizes should be printed in the 
#  term window. The Expected values are those used in XtSetValues 
#  and the Returned values are those retured by XtGetValues. The Returned 
#  values should be approximately equal to the Expected values.  This is 
#  because there is a rounding difference when converting 1000TH_INCHES 
#  to pixels.

# A arrow button should change size to 2000 x 1000. 
# Two messages should be printed in term window. The first says that
#  the size is set at 2000x1000. The next line is again the width and
#  height printed out. These values are returned by XtGetValues. The
#  width and height should be approximately 2000 by 1000.
#  This is because there is a rounding difference when

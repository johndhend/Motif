# HISTORY

# @) This test checks the visual appearance as well as the selectability
# of various widgets for their current state of sensitivity.
# A number of different widget types should be displayed in the window
# named \"Visual1\".  A second window named \"Sensitivity Toggles\" should
# be displayed. This window contains two toggle buttons. One for changing
# the sensitivity of all the displayed widgets in the top window and
# one for changing the sensitivity of their parent widget.

# C)
Continue

# #) The widgets in the window \"Visual1\" currently have their sensitivity
# set to True. Click BSelect on each of the widgets in this window.
# Verify that there is some visual effect in response to the selection
# of each widget.

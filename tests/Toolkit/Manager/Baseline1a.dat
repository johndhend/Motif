 * HISTORY
 */
#) The Shell widget for this test has been created with layout
direction set as Right-to-Left.
#) A client which contains a Frame with a label as the title child
   should appear. The full labelString \"Alignment String\" should
   be visible.
C)
#) A new label with the labelString \"Another Label\" should 
   appear. This is an now the title_child be use as the 
   Frame's title. This label should be layered on top
   on the original title child which is now set as 
   generic child (done by toolkit).
C)
#) The first label should again be use as the title child.
#) A ScrolledText widget with text should appear. The shadowThickness
   on the Frame should be 10, and the title labelString should be
   \"Alignment String\". It should centered both within the window
   and within the Frame.
C)
#) The marginWidth and marginHeight of the Frame should now change to
   be 20.
C)
#) A BulletinBoard dialog with three RadioBoxs and a Scale for 
   shadowThickness should appear. 
#) The toggle graphics should appear to the right of the toggle labels.
#) The string alignment should be set to the right for the scale and the
lowest scale value should be on the right.
#) Type a multiple line string into the Text widget in the control panel, and click the \"Apply String\" button.
#) Use the first RadioBox to change the Label's childVerticalAlignment.
#) Use the second RadioBox to change the Frames's shadowType.
#) Use the the third RadioBox to change the Label's 
   childHorizontalAlignment.  Since the layout direction is Right-to-Left,
   the label should align to the right when childHorizontalAlignment is set to
   the XmALIGNMENT_BEGINNING and the label should align to the left when
   childHorizontalAlignment is set to XmALIGNMENT_END.
#) Use the Scale to change the Frame's shadowThickness.
C)
#) The Font of the Label should change to be 9x15bold.
#) Use the control panel to change all of the resources.
C)
#) The labelString of the Frame title should change to
   \"Motif\\n Scrolled Text Widget\" it should appear on two lines.
   It should be centered within the Frame.
#) Use the control panel to change all of the resources.
C)
#) The Label's childType resources should change to FRAME_GENERIC_CHILD.
   This will make the cause the Label not to be a title for the Frame.
#) Use the control panel to change all of the resources. This should
   have no effect (except shadowThickness and shadowType).
C)
#) The Label will be destroyed, and a text widget with the string
   \"You can even use a Text Widget\" will now be created with its
   childType being FRAME_TITLE_CHILD. The Text widget is aligned
   at the end of the Frame, which should display to the left of the Frame.
#) Use the control panel to change all of the resources, which are now
   applicable to the Text widget and the Frame.
E)

@) This test checks the visual appearance as well as the selectability
of various widgets for their current state of sensitivity.
A number of different widget types should be displayed in the window
named \"Visual1\".  A second window named \"Sensitivity Toggles\" should
be displayed. This window contains two toggle buttons. One for changing
the sensitivity of all the displayed widgets in the top window and
one for changing the sensitivity of their parent widget.

C)

#) The widgets in the window \"Visual1\" currently have their sensitivity
set to True. Click BSelect on each of the widgets in this window.
Verify that there is some visual effect in response to the selection 
of each widget.

#) Now move to the window named \"Sensitivity Toggles\" and click BSelect
on the toggle button labelled \"Sensitive Children\".
The sensitivity of all of the widgets in \"Visual1\" has now been changed
to False. Verify that the appearance of each widget has changed to reflect
its current insensitive state. Most widgets should appear grayed out. 
Click BSelect on each of the widgets to verify that there is no response
to being selected.

C)

#) Click BSelect on the toggle labelled \"Insensitive Children\" to reset
the sensitivity of the widgets back to True. Click BSelect on each of the
widgets to verify that they are again sensitive to being selected.

#) Click BSelect on the toggle labelled \"Sensitive Parent\" to change
the sensitivity of the parent widget to False. The widgets in the window
\"Visual1\" should inherit their sensitivity from their parent widget
and thus become insensitive as well. Click BSelect on each of the
child widgets to verify that they are now insensitive.

#) Click BSelect on the toggle labelled \"Insensitive Parent\" to change
the sensitivity of the parent widget back to True. Verify that the sensitivity
of each of the child widgets was restored.

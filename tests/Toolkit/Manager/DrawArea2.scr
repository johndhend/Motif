# This is a simple Drawing Area client. 
# The focus is on the button. Press TAB to put the focus into the drawing 
# area. Press any key on the keyboard.  You should see a message about a 
# keypress being received but not processed.   This is normal and desireable.
# The Drawing area is surrounded by a frame and
#  itself should have a shadow thickness of 5 pixels.

# To use the client:  Click MB1 anywhere in the client. A line will be drawn
#  from 0,0 to your current location. Each time you click MB1, a line will

#  click MB2 or MB3, no line will be drawn, but the beginning point will be 
#  reset to your current location.

#) The bulletin board has a marginHeight and marginWidth as specified by
-u (UserData), and of 0 if not specified.
#) Four arrow buttons appear, side by side. (If the margin width or height is
large, some of the buttons may overlap.) The bulletin board's initial size
is large enough to show the buttons.
#) Click on top most button until it goes offscreen or stops moving.
#) Once the button has stopped moving, press Space a few times to request
additional moves.
#) Repeat for all other buttons.
#) All buttons should go equally far into the margins or beyond.
#) There should be no unexpected resizing behavior.
#) Go back and click on each button one more time. Again, there should be
no unexpected resizing.
C)
#) The margins have been doubled, or set to 10 if they were 0. 
#) The children which were outside of this margin are forced back inside it.
E)

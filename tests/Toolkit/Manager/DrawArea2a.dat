 * HISTORY
*/

!) This is a simple Drawing Area client with layout direction set
as Right-to-Left. 
#) The focus is on the button. Press TAB to put the focus
   into the drawing area. Press any key on the keyboard.
   You should see a message about a keypress being received
   but not processed.
   This is normal and desireable.
#) The Drawing area is surrounded by a frame and
   itself should have a shadow thickness of 5 pixels. 
#) To use the client:  Click MB1 anywhere in the client. A line will be drawn
   from 0,0 to your current location. For the current layout,
   the origin 0,0 will be located in the upper right corner.
Each time you click MB1, a line will be drawn from your
   previous location to your current location. If you click MB2 or MB3, no line will be drawn, but the beginning
   point will be reset to your current location.
#) Click Btn1 one more time anywhere in the Drawing Area. 
#) Press the Shift key. You should receive the message about keypress.
#) Press any other key alone, then with the Shift key held down. You should
receive the keypress message.
#) Draw another line with Btn1 clicks.
#) Press the PushButton. The DrawingArea will resize and several messages will
be printed out. None of the messages should mention that an error has 
been encountered.  When the DrawingArea resizes, the upper right corner should
be the origin from which the remainder of the drawing area grows and shrinks.
C)
#) The way button and key presses has been modified internally to use 
translations. Things should work the same way in the Drawing Area.
C)
#) An override shell has popped up, containing a label "Put the focus in
this window." Move your pointer into the override shell window.
E)

#) A Notebook will appear on your screen. 
   There will also be a control panel with which you can do a GetValues on
   those resources of the Notebook that are of type Dimension. (Since it
   may be hard to visually gauge what values these resources have been
   set to).
#) The width and height of the Notebook have been set to 200. 
#) The Notebook should have vertical orientation.
#) The placement of the back pages should be bottom left.
#) The Notebook binding should be the GNU pixmap.

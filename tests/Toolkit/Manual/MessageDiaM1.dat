#) A client containing a MessageBox Dialog should appear. The MessageBox
   should have a messageString of \"DialogStyle Unmanaged Test\", the OK button
   should have a label of \"UnManage\". The dialogStyle will be XmDIALOG_
MODELESS, so you may put the focus into clients or windows other than the
message box's.
#) The MessageDialog should be stacked on top of its client window.
#) Click MB1 on the Unmanage button. The Message Dialog should be Unmanaged and
   should \"pop down\". You now should be able to have focus in any window and
   the cursor should change back to the default cursor

that the message is expected.
C)

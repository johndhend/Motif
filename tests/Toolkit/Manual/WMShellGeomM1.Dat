   their new values by performing various window manager operations on
   the ApplicationShell window. (for example, with no iconBox, if you have 
   set new values for iconX and/or iconY, you should be able to check it 
   by iconifying the window, and noting the position of the icon on the 
   screen.)

   their new values by performing various window manager operations on
   the TopLevelShell window. (for example, with no iconBox, if you have 
   set new values for iconX and/or iconY, you should be able to check it 
   by iconifying the window, and noting the position of the icon on the 
   screen.)

#) To apply the changes to both the shells, select "All Shells" from the

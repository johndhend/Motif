This is just a basic tool, which provides a means of measuring distance
between any two points on the screen. Currently, the distances are shown
in pixels, millimeters, and inches.

To use this, set your PATH to the appropriate directory, and issue the
command:

     xmruler &

To measure any distance:

  1. click on "Measure" button. The shell is unmapped, the pointer is grabbed,
     and the cursor changes to "cross".

  2. Select the first point by clicking MB1. As soon as you select the 
     first point, the cursor changes to "reverse cross", and the grab is 
     still on. (This will be eventually changed to a rubberbanding cursor).

  3. Select the second point. The pointer is ungrabbed, the shell remapped,
     and the distances (both height and width on the screen) are displayed
     in pixels, millimeters, and inches.

  4. You can either quit by selecting Quit, or keep the ruler around by
     iconifying it.

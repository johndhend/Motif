 * HISTORY
 */


@) This test should be run automated since it requires the automation
   performance monitor to measure the time lapsed for the given
   actions listed on the following panels.

@) A SpinBox will be displayed with a XmNUMERIC SpinBox child.
   The following resource values have been set:

#) XmNminimumValue = 1
#) XmNmaximumValue = 2
#) XmNincrementValue = 1

#) Click on the increment arrow 500 times in order to spin through the
   minimum to maximum values 250 times.

C)

@) The following SpinBox resource values have been updated as follows:

#) XmNminimumValue = 1
#) XmNmaximumValue = 500 
#) XmNincrementValue = 1

#) Click on the increment arrow 500 times in order to spin through all
   the SpinBox values. 

C)

@) An output file, SpinBoxPerf2.prt, will be generated which lists the
   times measured for the previous two testcases.
   Check that there is not a significant difference between the time
   lapsed for each of the two testcases. 

C)
E)

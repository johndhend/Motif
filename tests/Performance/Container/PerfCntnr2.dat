#) This is the Performance Container Test 2.
#) The number of object created is the number you gave on the command line.
   500 by default (or max).
#) The container widget should be displayed in its LargeIcon view, with an 
   OUTLINE layout type. 
#) All the Icon gadgets should be expanded, in a binary tree.
#) Each Icon gadget should display pixmap-label combination, with the pixmap 
   displaying the letter "L" on a black background.
#) Collapse and expand buttons should work fine.

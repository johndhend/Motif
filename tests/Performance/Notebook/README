This directory contains one test, PNotebook1. It
creates a Notebook with 500 pages of the type specified by the user
on the command line. It also creates 50 major tabs and 20 minor tabs.


To run the test manually, type the following on the command line:

PNotebook1 -u <XmWidget>

To get a list of possible widgets, just type 'PNotebook1' on the command
line.

To run the test automated, build the Makefile for automation,
and type 'PNotebook1 -u <XmWidget> -c -T' on the command line. This
will run the test with the nocompare and TRACE options.
Running the test automated will generate a PNotebook1.prt file, which will 
contain output from the automation performance monitor, as explained below.
NOTE : For performance testing purposes, run the test with 'XmFrame' as
the 'XmWidget' option.

The automated version of the test uses the PNotebook1.scr script file.
These are the user actions tested in the script file:

1. Resizing the Notebook
2. Scrolling through the major tabs once. (i.e, one click on the tab scroller)
3. Scrolling forwards through all pages of the Notebook using the page 
   scroller.
4. Scrolling backwards through all pages of the Notebook using the page 
   scroller.
5. Clicking on a major tab that will display page 100.
6. Traversing from one tab group to the next. (specifically, from the major tab
   to the minor tab group).

This is done within the test code:

7. Updating all the major tabs to have different page numbers.
8. Changing the shadow thickness of all major tabs to be 3.


The script for this test uses the automation performance monitor,
which will measure the time taken for the user actions/changes to
Notebook caused within the test.  You will get 8 sets of
numbers for the test. Each sets corresponds to one of the actions/changes
in the list above. The list above gives test actions in order, so
just match any set of numbers with the corresponding item in the list.

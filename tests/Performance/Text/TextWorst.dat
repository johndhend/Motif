 * HISTORY
 */

@) This test measures the performance of a Scrolled XmText widget.
   The time lapsed is measured for the following actions:
@)  - Assigning text to an XmText widget with XmTextSetString().
@)  - Scrolling to the end of the displayed text.
@)  - Scrolling to the beginning of the displayed text.

@) An output file, TextWorst.out, will be created in the current
   directory.  This file will list the performance measurements made
   throughout the test. 

#) Click MB1 on the pushbutton labelled \"Fill Text\".  The widget
   will be filled with the letter 'n'. 

#) Click MB1 on the pushbutton labelled \"Scroll To End\". The text
   widget will scroll to the end of the file.

#) Click MB1 on the pushbutton labelled \"Scroll To Begin\". The text
   widget will scroll back to the beginning of the file.

#) Click MB1 on \"Quit\" to exit the test.

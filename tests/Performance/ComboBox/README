2. Adds one item to the bottom of the list when the top is visible.
3. Adds one item to the bottom of the list when the bottom is visible.
4. Deletes one item from the bottom of the list when the top is visible
5. Deletes one item from the bottom of the list when the bottom is visible.


To run the test, type the following on the command line:

You can also run the test automated, to get output from the Automation
performance monitor. to do this, build the Makefile for automation,
and type 'PComboBox1 -c -T' on the command line. This
will run the test with the nocompare and TRACE options.

To run the tests:

Usage: focus [-x startx] [-y y_decr] [-n trials] [-m max_xpos] [-s x_step] [-h]
where - 
        startx - X position from where to start moving the cursor
        y_decr - Y value to be subtracted from screen height to get y pos.
        trials - no. of roundtrips that the cursor will make
        max_xpos - Max. value of X cursor will move to in forward direction
        x_step - steps in no. of pixels cursor willmove in X direction
        "-h" - will print out this message

For example, to run 1000 roundtrips with an x step of 1, do:

focus_icon -n 1000 -s 1
focus_win -n 1000 -s 1

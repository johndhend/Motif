The destination coordinate is specified using the \*VXCoordinate\*O and
\*VYCoordinate\*O arguments. Both coordinates are relative to the root window.
The \*LDragXYAbs\*O command
is composed of a call to \*LPressMB\*O, a call to \*LLocatePointerXYAbs\*O
to move to the destination, and finally a call to \*LReleaseMB\*O.

X coordinate relative to the root window.
.IP "\*VYCoordinate\*O"
Y coordinate relative to the root window.

.SH NAME
\*LWindowMove \*O\(em Command to move a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*LWindowMove\*O
\*VWidgetName x y\*O
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\*LWindowMove\*O
command will move the window associated with
\*VWidgetName\*O
to the location
\*Vx, y\*O.
If
\*VWidgetName\*O
is not a shell with its own window on the display, the window
of the nearest shell parent in the widget hierarchy will be used.
This function is executed by moving the pointer to the middle of
the titlebar of the window, generating a mouse Select button press
and drag until the window is positioned at
\*Vx, y\*O. When using \*LWindowMove\*O with a TearOff Menu, 
\*VWidgetName\*O should be one of the widgets contained in the original
Pulldown or PopupMenu.

X coordinate of the new position on the screen to which you wish to move the
window.

window.

a Scale or ScrollBar.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*LDragSliderValue\*O
\*VDirection Value [ModifierList]* [Button]\*O
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\*LDragSliderValue\*O
command will drag to a particular value on a Scale or ScrollBar.
The \*LDragSliderValue\*O composed of a call to \*LPressMB\*O, a call to 
\*LLocatePointer\*O to move to the coordinates that represent the proper
Scale or ScrollBar value, and then a call to \*LReleaseMB\*O.
.IP "\*VDirection\*O" 13n
Direction in which to Drag. Valid values are \*VUp, Down, Right, Left\*O.
.IP "\*VValue\*O"
Value on the slider or Scale you wish to Drag to. Value must be
between \*LXmNminimum\*O and \*LXmNmaximum\*O. The literals \*LMin\*O and \*LMax\*O
may be used to specify the widget's maximum and minimum respectively.
.IP "\*V[ModifierList]*\*O"
List of Modifiers to modify the mouse button press. For a full list of
available Modifiers see \*LModifierList(3X)\*O. The default is no modifiers.
.IP "\*V[Button]\*O"
Button to be pressed. For a full list of available
Buttons see \*LButtonList(3X)\*O. The default is Button1.
.PP 
For more information about \*LDragSliderValue\*O, see
the \*EOSF/Motif Quality Assurance Test Suite User's Guide\*O.
.SH EXAMPLE
\*LDragSliderValue Up 97 <Ctrl> Btn2\*O
.PP
This command will generate a drag from the current location (usually
the scale's slider) upwards until the value of the scale is
97, using Button2 modified by the \*LCtrl\*O key.
.PP
Note that \*LMin\*O and \*LMax\*O are reversed for a
Scale and a ScrollBar. In a left-to-right environment, a Scale's \*LMax\*O 
is on top by default. A ScrollBar's
\*LMax\*O, however, is on the bottom by default.

This directory contains the QATS Test Suite Users Guide.  It
is in sml format.  The following files are in this directory:

	ch[01-06].sm	- source in sml format for the chapters
	title.sm	- source in sml format for the title page
	preface.sm	- source in sml format for the preface
	*.3X		- source for the man pages included in the book
	Description	- sml "Makefile" for this book
	Headers/	- directory that contains header information
			  for build the book

Directories needed:
-------------------

	/project/tools/bin/<platform>
	/project/dte


To build the entire book and create PostScript files:
-----------------------------------------------------

	book-format -d -t all

This will create Output/draft/ps and Sync directories.  The
PostScript files are in Output/draft/ps and Sync is used to
keep track of page numbers for the table of contents and index.
NB, I have built the book on OSF/1, but have not been able to
on HPs.  Apparently tbl is not installed and CF has been informed.


To build man page(s):
-------------------------

	dman -d  -t <man_page.3X> | lpr  (or can redirect to PostScript file)


To build chapter(s):
--------------------

	book-format -d -t <target_name_in_Description>

Puts PostScript output in Output/draft/ps.  Note that if you just build
a chapter before building the entire book, page and chapter numbers may
be out of sync and odd (like chpt 100).  This is because the Sync directory
is not created until you build the whole book.  Building chapters after
the Sync directory exists is okay.


Adding new man pages:
---------------------

Just add the .3X file.


Adding new chapters:
--------------------

Add the .sm file and create a target in the Description file.

Motif 2.5.0

  * Motif is a trim well made window manager (mwm) and also X-app dev
    kit for (archaic: simplified) release of X apps using it.  Motif has
    many X features yet no lib dependencies besides X.  Still in the list
    of those seeking a trim, featured, and reliable window manager.

  * For freeBSD 12.2 with Xorg installed sans Xprint, Xp is not in Xorg in 12.2

  * 64 bit build, remade simple 'weatherable ' Makefiles, just several seconds
    to make + install, no autoconfig

  * Switch-Desktop app (panner) now has zoom in/out, stability improved.

  * Optional imake cf build w/quats, but suggest as not default (not as
    weatherable to OS changes, but also is working in freeBSD 12.2)

  * A re-release of OpenGroup Motif 2.2.3 for freeBSD 12.2, Motif is no
    no longer releasing new enhancements; the kit was release as open.

  * For more About, and CHANGELOG, see NEWS in source tarball.
